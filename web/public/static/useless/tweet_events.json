CEX execs rarely do this unless a listing is on their radar. Kraken is one of the top US exchanges, so this is massive\n- Uphold (top retail trading app with 10m+ users) memed and highlighted $USELESS on its official Twitter. again, CEXs don\u2019t do this for fun \u2014 if they\u2019re publicly watching it, it\u2019s usually because they\u2019re eyeing it for a listing \ud83d\udc40\n- USELESS crossed 13,000 holders and recorded more user growth than most top memecoins last week\n- multiple major crypto publications and top CT accounts were forced to acknowledge USELESS due to how strong the performance and meme was relative to the rest of the market\n- the community is evolving into a full-blown cult. even Coindesk had to call it 'crypto's newest memecoin cult'\n\nso much has happened so fast, and it's easy to lose track in this kind of environment\n\nbut as we just witnessed with USELESS\u2019s sudden, explosive 2,500% rally in 2 weeks...\n\nthose who can\u2019t HODL tend to get sidelined\n\n#USELESS is the next breakout blue-chip memecoin to watch",

      "text": "i'm sharing the full message blurred in the quoted tweet since many keep asking\n\nit was posted earlier in a group chat in response to a comment about 'top blasting' USELESS and whether it has '$WIF-like potential'\n\n------\ni think for something that has run super hard (i.e. from $4m to $150m in ~2 weeks) there will be a cool down at some point before an eventual, more explosive leg up\n\ni mean for memecoins, especially one that has rallied with many being sidelined, it's generally bullish to shake off a bit of unbelievers who are up a lot before a more super aggressive move to higher, insane valuations\n\nit's hard to say exactly when this would happen though, because many expected a pull back way before the current levels, and even though i have very optimistic targets for USELESS, even i did not expect it to just go on a 'no breaks' pump from $4m to $150m in just a few weeks tbh\n\nwhat i'm super confident about, regardless of short term moves, is that this is eventually a billion dollar memecoin\n\ni'm saying this based on the memetics, lore, group of core holders, as well as other on-chain metrics (which Nansen, Stalkchain, and Sunflow have been talking about a lot recently)\n\ni also know from being close to the CTO team that T1s and CEXs have taken active interest in this one and discussions are ongoing; ofc it's hard to say where discussions end, but there's a level of interest from them that seems unusual this early for a memecoin\n\nthen you have:\n\n- other form of engagements from respectable CEXs that are not t1s: Kraken Co-CEO and a listing manager publicly memeing it just last week, Crypto.com listing it organically yesterday (they rarely do this!), Kucoin listing for free, etc\n- confluence from a lot of savvy memecoin guys, including those early to WIF and Fartcoin\n- it being the first solid memecoin to come out from the trenches since TRUMP; i can't think of anything that has been sticky since then\n- way too many people getting sidelined on this rally; this is evident on CT, even in the trenches, etc (many will try to position on the next significant pullback)\n- the fact that a higher market cap makes it more interesting i.e. a $500m 'USELESS coin' is more memeable than a $100m USELESS coin, for example. good case in point is the convo involving [redacted] in this chat the other day: smart folks are naturally going to get triggered by this doing insane valuations when it's hard for 'good stuff' to get funding and traction, and that will only fuel press which helps it. it should also fuel industry wide criticism at some super high valuation, for many reasons but more so for the fact that it is 'insulting' and 'ridiculous' that some memecoin deriding the entire industry as USELESS is trading 'THAT HIGH!!!'\n- i should also add that Wintermute recently reached out to me highlighting its strength; i never pitched it to them and haven't had discussions with them in ages. knowing how they operate, the fact that they reached out indicates that they're seeing interest in it from big money or CEXs\n\nUSELESS coin has all of the ingredients of a blue chip memecoin\n\nand interestingly every single WIF OG i've seen in it do not just believe it has ingredients of a 'wif style' move, but they actually think it has potential for a higher ceiling compared to wif... because the meme is 'not as niche' compared to WIF\n\nso, i do think this has all the ingredients\n\neven more so because it had a lot of buzz when it first came out and CT did a whole circus around it when it retraced 90% from $40m to $4m, denouncing it as dead, only for it to pull a 3,000% move from $4m to $150m... so even if it does get a significant pullback, i don't think anyone will consider it 'dead' this time around. people will simply find an opportunity to position and the FOMO from the next move will be more than the current one\n\nthat being said, i do personally think a scenario in which it gets a form of pullback + consolidation before the next leg up will be bullish for a few reasons:\n\n- it gets more power brokers in; so much salt from sidelinoors rn, so it doesn't hurt if a few get a good entry that allows them to push it hard since they would have vested interests\n- it should result in a lot of 'new money' that are up 1,000% to 3,000% getting out now which should create less resistance in the future\n- it makes a statement about the longevity of the memecoin: 'it keeps surviving major corrections'",

      "text": "i've seen a few comments suggest that my post yesterday (quote tweeted) was me fudding #USELESS coin\n\non the contrary, my post has actually demonstrated the following:\n\n1. USELESS remains the strongest memecoin in the market right now: some wallets started dumping after my tweet, and one even full-stacked a massive amount of tokens that crashed the price 15% in one clip. guess what happened? his dump was insta-bought back above the pre-sell price in mere seconds\n\n2. USELESS rapidly gained hundreds of new holders who absorbed the large sell-offs triggered by initial sell pressure\n\n3. USELESS hit a new ATH mere hours after my original post, which many claimed was \u201cFUD\u201d that induced selling\n\n4. USELESS has held stronger than any other major memecoin through the memecoin bloodbath happening today (don\u2019t take my word for it, see the attached screenshot!)\n\n5. USELESS has proven it doesn\u2019t rely on just one man to succeed. it\u2019s a strong narrative rapidly gaining traction, and a much bigger idea than just me. there\u2019s a lot of smart money and heavyweights watching it, and even if i were to stop pushing it for whatever reason (i won\u2019t, God willing!), someone else will likely pick up the baton and run harder\n\ndon\u2019t get me wrong, i do not in any way underestimate my influence:\n\ni know i\u2019ve gotten a lot of people into USELESS, but things have only worked this well because the narrative is strong and sticky. it wouldn\u2019t have done quite as well if it was some dog poo narrative\n\nand i\u2019m sure more big accounts will start popping up to talk about it as they notice its consistent relative strength (many have been DM\u2019ing me saying they\u2019re accumulating it as their biggest high-conviction memecoin play, fwiw)\n\nsome people also insinuated that i posted yesterday\u2019s tweet because i wanted to sell\n\ni\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s because they have a reading comprehension issue, but i never said or implied anything close to that\n\nmany people trust and follow my takes, some blindly, and i felt i owed it to them to be factual and transparent: anything that rallies super aggressively in a short time can have a pullback before the next leg up\n\ni was clear that i didn\u2019t know when that pullback might happen, but some interpreted it as me calling a local top... which is strange!\n\nmany strong memecoins in the past have gone from nothing to billions in weeks, so just because i said there might be a pullback eventually doesn\u2019t mean it will happen now\n\nif you believe in the narrative and don\u2019t have exposure, the best way to enter is to DCA, rather than FOMO buy what you think might be a local top or wait for a dip that may never come at the levels you're watching\n\nanyway, my USELESS-related tweets are not for short-term traders. they\u2019re for people who have vision and believe in the narrative!\n\njust as i said yesterday, some weak hands tried to make my post a self-fulfilling prophecy... but they greatly underestimated USELESS coin\u2019s strength, and i\u2019m glad everyone got to watch that play out in real time\n\ni also want to make it very clear: i have not sold a single USELESS token, and i do not intend to sell until we get clear PVE and it becomes a unicorn (i.e. billions)\n\nof course, if needed, i\u2019d be happy to contribute some of my tokens to support listings on T0/T1 CEXs (several of which, from what i understand, are actively engaging the CTO team right now)\n\ni bought a bit on the way down when everyone lost hope\u2014mainly on my public wallet, but also a few on non-tracked ones (not impossible to track, but i won\u2019t be sharing to avoid botting by copytraders like on my main one)\n\ni also have a USELESS perps trade open on WOOFi Pro and Raydium (both powered by @OrderlyNetwork). i haven\u2019t mentioned this before because every time i do, i get accused of pumping my positions\u2014so i stopped announcing most of my new perps trades\n\ni opened this leverage long around $40m market cap. i could only use a little over $20k in margin because it's illiquid and they capped my long size. i'm up over 1,000% on that trade (see screenshot). i\u2019ll likely rotate it into spot soon since the funding is eating into my gains\n\ni don\u2019t know how orderly calculates funding, but longing USELESS has become prohibitively expensive on the platform\u2014so i\u2019m considering moving it to spot. and even that rotation should be bullish, since futures/perps don\u2019t require holding the asset, while spot adds real, trackable buy pressure.\n\nto conclude:\n\nUSELESS has had the best relative strength among memecoins today. it\u2019s a bigger narrative than i, and i haven\u2019t sold a single token despite being up massively on both my spot and perps holdings!",

      "text": "pullbacks on #USELESS coin have rarely exceeded ~35% since it started its monster run a month ago\n\nand every single time it happens there are a lot of sidelined people who see it and decide to fade\n\nusually because they thought 'it's going to dip harder'\n\nor because they thought 'the rally might have come to an end'\n\n100% of the time so far, USELESS coin has simply gone on to make a new ATH days later... sometimes even mere hours later\n\nthen these same users come out crying in frustration about how they got sidelined again and should have bought... rinse and repeat!\n\nUSELESS coin just gave another ~35% dip\n\nand IMO this is a good opportunity for sidelined capital to size in before the next leg up\n\nas the leading coin in the BonkFun eco which is rapidly gaining attention, there is a lot of focus on USELESS\n\noutside of that, it is by far the strongest memecoin narrative to emerge from the trenches this year\n\nwhen you also consider the fact that the memecoin category (a category filled with useless coins) is worth $59.3 billion\n\nand when you compare the market cap of top memecoins (all useless coins!)\n\n- $DOGE: $25.4 billion\n- $SHIB: $7 billion\n- $PEPE: $4.2 billion\n- $TRUMP: $1.7 billion\n- $SPX: $1.2 billion\n- #FARTCOIN: $1.1 billion\n\nthen it is clear that USELESS coin is incredibly undervalued here at $233 million market cap\n\nyou're literally getting the opportunity to buy a multi-billion dollar, blue chip memecoin at a ridiculous discount\n\nin addition, the fundamentals point to new ATHs soon for USELESS coin:\n\n- volume on this dip is around ATHs level, showing that this dip is getting bought up aggressively\n- its holder count continues to increase on the dip\n- smart money and whales continue to size in on the dip\n- it remains one of the highest mindshare memecoins in all of crypto at the moment\n- several high-profile CEXs have directly engaged with tweets about USELESS coin e.g. Binance US, Kraken, etc, while it is yet to be listed on these platforms. this means CEX listings are still a key catalyst to look forward to\n\nin a trillion-dollar industry widely regarded as useless, or a $59 billion memecoin sector widely regarded as useless, USELESS coin is currently the purest memecoin narrative\n\nand that, coupled with its fundamentals, puts it in a unique position to be one of the leading memecoins in the entire space",

      "text": "many have been asking why i am so damn bullish on #USELESS coin\n\nit's simple\n\nfundamentals do not lie\n\ni've been trading memecoins for several cycles now\n\ni witnessed the rise of $DOGE from nothing to $90 billion market cap during the memestock movement in 2021\n\ni witnessed the rise of $SHIB and its eruption from being dismissed as a doge beta to pumping to $43 billion and flipping doge temporarily\n\ni witnessed the rise of $FLOKI after $SHIB and its meteoric ascent from being rugged by its initial dev to turbosending to $3.5 billion in mere months after a CTO team took over\n\n$BONK, $PEPE, $WIF, #FARTCOIN... you name it\n\ni've seen all of their rallies play out before my very eyes while being locked-in in the trenches\n\ni routinely made 7-8 figures last cycle from random memecoins that many on here have never even heard of\n\noccasionally, people on here try to spread the 'bonk guy is a clueless retard who just got lucky on one trade' narrative whenever i say something they don't like\n\nin reality, last cycle i went from turning practically nothing into crazy amounts even i am afraid of uttering here (my peak public PNLs here look like peanuts in comparison)\n\nand i've been doing the same again this time around... except i'm doing it publicly and in real time in front of everyone\n\ni've played memecoins to a point where i now kind of have a sixth sense for coins that are destined to send\n\neven at that, i've nailed it down to a science for what makes a memecoin primed for explosive, mainstream success\n\nand i haven't seen a memecoin that fits all of the key criteria like USELESS coin does in a very, very long time\n\n- narrative? it's literally a useless coin just like 99% of crypto, except it is brutally honest. the higher its market cap, the stronger the narrative and potential\n- liquidity? there's a total of $11.5 million+ in DEX liquidity across various pools for USELESS coin according to DEXScreener. that's plenty for a memecoin at its current market cap\n- volume? USELESS coin has traded over $50.5 million in DEX volume today, making it the third most traded memecoin on-chain besides $FARTCOIN and $TRUMP, which are both above $1 billion market cap. USELESS has consistently traded $40m to $60m in daily on-chain volume for most of this month\n- do you think it's a random accident that some new memecoin is consistently trading an average of $50 million in daily on-chain volume and outranking every other memecoin on EVERY CHAIN in volume except $TRUMP and $FARTCOIN?\n- many saw the Bybit perps listing happen randomly and organically for USELESS last week. that was simply the first domino. Binance, Coinbase, Robinhood, Upbit, and everyone else will list it eventually. that kind of volume is simply too strong for CEXs to resist\n- attention? USELESS coin is an attention magnet. whether to express surprise about its price action, condemn it and express strong hate, or cheer it for winning, CT simply can't resist talking about it. while this might have started on CT, it\u2019s going to spill over to TikTok, Instagram, and mainstream media eventually\n- sidelined capital? USELESS coin is the best-performing memecoin of this year. it's up 7,700% in a little over a month, yet 90% of CT either hates it with passion or is completely sidelined. i've seen a lot in memecoins before, but USELESS coin is the first coin ever where i've seen this level of sidelined energy, which makes me feel even i am not bullish enough\n- cult community? USELESS coin community is built different. even Coindesk had to admit it's the 'newest crypto memecoin cult'\n\nUSELESS coin has the exact same ingredients that were present in $DOGE, $SHIB, $PEPE, $FARTCOIN, etc, in their early days before they exploded to multi-billions and stayed firmly above $1 billion market cap\n\nbut it also has one ingredient they never had: an incredible, unbelievable level of cope and sidelined energy from CT\n\nthe fundamentals simply align for USELESS coin to go to BILLIONS and BILLIONS\n\ni've seen this play out on countless memecoins before, and it has always ended the same way: BILLIONS\n\ni have an extraordinarily unshakeable belief in the fact that USELESS coin is going to billions\n\ni was screaming this when it was at sub-$10 million market cap\n\ni was screaming it at $100 million when people were chiding me for 'shilling a coin that is up 1,000% to my followers'\n\ni was screaming it at $200 million market cap when people were 'sure it's gonna pull back to $50 million before next leg up'\n\ni was screaming it at $300 million and on the several subsequent pullbacks from there to $200m when many were sure it was done or would have some massive, extensive correction before it continued to go up\n\nand here i am again screaming it at $320 million before the next leg up to $1 billion market cap\n\ni resolutely believe that USELESS will be a top 5 memecoin before the end of the cycle and that its rally to $1 billion+ will happen a lot more swiftly and aggressively than many expect\n\nGOD WILLING",

Literalmente es una moneda in\u00fatil como el 99% de las criptos, pero esta lo dice sin rodeos. Cuanto mayor sea su market cap, m\u00e1s fuerte es su narrativa y potencial.\n\nLiquidez? Seg\u00fan DEXScreener, hay m\u00e1s de 11.5 millones de d\u00f3lares en liquidez DEX repartidos en varios pools para USELESS coin. Eso es mucho para una memecoin con su capitalizaci\u00f3n actual.\n\nVolumen? USELESS coin ha tenido hoy m\u00e1s de 50.5 millones en volumen de trading en DEX, siendo la tercera memecoin m\u00e1s intercambiada en la blockchain despu\u00e9s de $FARTCOIN y $TRUMP, ambas con capitalizaciones superiores a mil millones.\n\nDurante casi todo este mes, ha mantenido entre 40 y 60 millones diarios en volumen on-chain.\n\n\u00bfDe verdad crees que es una coincidencia que una memecoin nueva est\u00e9 promediando 50 millones al d\u00eda en volumen on-chain y superando a todas las dem\u00e1s memecoins en TODAS LAS CADENAS, excepto $TRUMP y $FARTCOIN?\n\nBybit? La gente vio c\u00f3mo USELESS fue listada la semana pasada en los perps de Bybit de forma aparentemente org\u00e1nica. Pero eso fue solo el primer domin\u00f3. Binance, Coinbase, Robinhood, Upbit y las dem\u00e1s la acabar\u00e1n listando. Ese nivel de volumen es demasiado para que un CEX lo ignore.\n\nAtenci\u00f3n? USELESS coin es un im\u00e1n de atenci\u00f3n. Ya sea por sorpresa, por odio intenso, por burla o por celebrar su \u00e9xito, en Crypto Twitter no pueden dejar de hablar de ella.\n\nLo que empez\u00f3 en CT pronto se extender\u00e1 a TikTok, Instagram y medios convencionales.\n\nCapital al margen? USELESS es la memecoin con mejor rendimiento de este a\u00f1o. Ha subido un 7,700% en poco m\u00e1s de un mes, y aun as\u00ed, el 90% de CT la odia o la ignora por completo.\n\nHe visto muchas memecoins antes, pero esta es la primera vez que veo tanto dinero y energ\u00eda esperando al margen, lo cual me hace pensar que ni siquiera yo soy lo suficientemente alcista.\n\nComunidad tipo culto? La comunidad de USELESS coin es diferente. Incluso Coindesk tuvo que admitir que es el \"nuevo culto de memecoin cripto\".\n\n---\n\nUSELESS coin tiene los mismos ingredientes exactos que tuvieron $DOGE, $SHIB, $PEPE, $FARTCOIN, etc., en sus primeros d\u00edas antes de explotar a miles de millones y mantenerse por encima de 1B en capitalizaci\u00f3n.\n\nPero tiene un ingrediente m\u00e1s que ninguna de esas tuvo:\nuna incre\u00edble y absurda cantidad de envidia, negaci\u00f3n y energ\u00eda reprimida desde CT.\n\nLos fundamentos est\u00e1n perfectamente alineados para que USELESS coin llegue a los miles de millones.\n\nHe visto este patr\u00f3n muchas veces antes con memecoins.\nY siempre termin\u00f3 igual:\n\nMILES DE MILLONES.\n\n---\n\nTengo una fe extraordinariamente inquebrantable de que USELESS coin va a llegar a los miles de millones.\n\nLo gritaba cuando su market cap estaba por debajo de los $10 millones.\n\nLo gritaba cuando lleg\u00f3 a $100 millones y la gente me criticaba por \"hacer shill de una moneda que ya subi\u00f3 un 1000%\".\n\nLo gritaba cuando lleg\u00f3 a $200 millones y muchos dec\u00edan \"va a caer a $50M antes de seguir subiendo\".\n\nLo gritaba a $300 millones, y tambi\u00e9n durante todas las correcciones posteriores hasta $200 millones, cuando muchos aseguraban que ya hab\u00eda terminado o que iba a haber una gran correcci\u00f3n antes de subir m\u00e1s.\n\nY aqu\u00ed estoy de nuevo, grit\u00e1ndolo a $320 millones antes de la siguiente subida a un market cap de mil millones.\n\nCreo con total determinaci\u00f3n que USELESS estar\u00e1 en el top 5 de memecoins antes de que termine este ciclo\n\ny que su subida a m\u00e1s de mil millones ser\u00e1 mucho m\u00e1s r\u00e1pida y agresiva de lo que muchos esperan.\n\nSI DIOS QUIERE.",

C\u2019est litt\u00e9ralement un \u00ab\u00a0coin inutile\u00a0\u00bb, comme 99\u00a0% de la crypto \u2014 sauf qu\u2019il l\u2019admet franchement. Plus sa market cap est \u00e9lev\u00e9e, plus le narratif devient puissant.\n\nLiquidit\u00e9\u00a0? Selon DEXScreener, il y a plus de 11,5 millions de dollars de liquidit\u00e9 DEX r\u00e9partis sur plusieurs pools pour USELESS \u2014 \u00e9norme pour un memecoin \u00e0 cette taille.\n\nVolume\u00a0? Aujourd\u2019hui, USELESS a fait plus de 50,5 millions de dollars de volume sur DEX, ce qui en fait le troisi\u00e8me memecoin le plus \u00e9chang\u00e9 on-chain, juste apr\u00e8s $FARTCOIN et $TRUMP (qui ont tous les deux plus d\u2019un milliard de market cap). Il a fait entre $40M et $60M de volume quotidien presque tout le mois.\n\nVous pensez que c\u2019est un hasard qu\u2019un nouveau memecoin fasse 50 millions par jour en moyenne, surpassant tous les autres memecoins sur toutes les cha\u00eenes, sauf $TRUMP et $FARTCOIN\u00a0?\n\nBeaucoup ont vu la cotation sur les perp\u00e9tuels Bybit la semaine derni\u00e8re comme un \u00e9v\u00e9nement spontan\u00e9. Ce n\u2019\u00e9tait que le premier domino. Binance, Coinbase, Robinhood, Upbit et les autres suivront. Ce niveau de volume est trop fort pour \u00eatre ignor\u00e9 par les CEX.\n\nAttention\u00a0? USELESS coin est un aimant \u00e0 attention. Que ce soit pour exprimer la surprise, la haine, ou les encouragements \u2014 CT ne peut pas s\u2019emp\u00eacher d\u2019en parler. Et m\u00eame si \u00e7a a commenc\u00e9 sur CT, \u00e7a va se propager sur TikTok, Instagram et dans les m\u00e9dias traditionnels.\n\nCapital en attente\u00a0? USELESS est le memecoin le plus performant de l\u2019ann\u00e9e, avec une mont\u00e9e de +7700\u00a0% en un peu plus d\u2019un mois \u2014 et pourtant, 90\u00a0% de CT soit le d\u00e9teste, soit reste totalement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cart.\n\nJ\u2019ai vu beaucoup de memecoins avant, mais jamais autant d\u2019\u00e9nergie en attente \u2014 au point que m\u00eame moi, je me demande si je suis assez haussier.\n\nCommunaut\u00e9 culte\u00a0? Celle de USELESS est hors norme. M\u00eame Coindesk a d\u00fb admettre que c\u2019est \u00ab\u00a0le nouveau culte crypto autour d\u2019un memecoin\u00a0\u00bb.\n\nUSELESS coin a exactement les m\u00eames ingr\u00e9dients que $DOGE, $SHIB, $PEPE, $FARTCOIN, etc. dans leurs d\u00e9buts avant qu\u2019ils n\u2019explosent \u00e0 plusieurs milliards de capitalisation.\n\nMais USELESS coin a un ingr\u00e9dient unique que les autres n\u2019ont jamais eu\u00a0:\n\nun niveau de rejet, de scepticisme, de haine passive et d\u2019\u00e9nergie en attente sur CT qui est tout simplement incroyable.\n\nLes fondamentaux sont parfaitement align\u00e9s pour que USELESS coin atteigne des MILLIARDS et des MILLIARDS.\n\nJ\u2019ai vu ce sc\u00e9nario se r\u00e9p\u00e9ter innombrables fois avec d\u2019autres memecoins, et la fin est toujours la m\u00eame\u00a0: MILLIARDS.\n\nJ\u2019ai une foi in\u00e9branlable que USELESS coin atteindra plusieurs milliards.\n\nJe le disais quand il valait moins de 10 millions.\n\nJe le criais \u00e0 100 millions, m\u00eame quand on me reprochait de \u00ab\u00a0pousser un coin d\u00e9j\u00e0 mont\u00e9 de 1000\u00a0% aupr\u00e8s de mes followers\u00a0\u00bb.\n\nJe le disais \u00e0 200 millions, m\u00eame quand les gens \u00e9taient s\u00fbrs qu\u2019il allait redescendre \u00e0 $50M.\n\nJe le disais \u00e0 300 millions, et m\u00eame lors de plusieurs retours \u00e0 $200M, alors que beaucoup le croyaient fini ou s\u2019attendaient \u00e0 une grosse correction.\n\nEt me voil\u00e0 encore, \u00e0 $320 millions, criant qu\u2019il est pr\u00eat pour sa prochaine jambe vers $1 MILLIARD de market cap.\n\nJe crois fermement que USELESS sera dans le top 5 des memecoins avant la fin du cycle\n\net que sa mont\u00e9e \u00e0 plus d\u2019un milliard de market cap sera beaucoup plus rapide et violente que ce que la majorit\u00e9 imagine.\n\nSI DIEU LE VEUT.",

At\u00e9 o Coindesk teve que admitir que \u00e9 \u201co novo culto de memecoin cripto.\u201d\n\n---\n\nA USELESS coin tem exatamente os mesmos ingredientes que $DOGE, $SHIB, $PEPE, $FARTCOIN, etc. tinham nos seus primeiros dias \u2014 antes de explodirem para m\u00faltiplos bilh\u00f5es e se manterem acima de US$ 1 bilh\u00e3o.\n\nMas ela tem um ingrediente que nenhuma delas jamais teve:\num n\u00edvel inacredit\u00e1vel de rejei\u00e7\u00e3o, nega\u00e7\u00e3o e energia reprimida do CT.\n\nOs fundamentos est\u00e3o perfeitamente alinhados para que USELESS chegue a BILH\u00d5ES e BILH\u00d5ES.\n\nJ\u00e1 vi isso acontecer com in\u00fameras memecoins antes, e sempre termina do mesmo jeito:\nem BILH\u00d5ES.\n\n---\n\nTenho uma cren\u00e7a extraordinariamente firme de que a USELESS coin vai atingir m\u00faltiplos bilh\u00f5es.\n\nEu gritava isso quando ela estava abaixo de US$ 10 milh\u00f5es.\n\nEu gritava isso quando estava a US$ 100 milh\u00f5es e diziam que eu estava \u201cvendendo uma moeda que j\u00e1 subiu 1.000% pros meus seguidores.\u201d\n\nGritava isso quando chegou a US$ 200 milh\u00f5es e diziam que \u201ccom certeza vai cair pra US$ 50M antes de subir mais.\u201d\n\nGritava isso a US$ 300 milh\u00f5es \u2014 e nas v\u00e1rias corre\u00e7\u00f5es subsequentes de volta aos US$ 200M \u2014 quando muitos achavam que tinha acabado ou que viria uma corre\u00e7\u00e3o brutal.\n\nE aqui estou de novo, gritando isso a US$ 320 milh\u00f5es, antes da pr\u00f3xima pernada rumo a US$ 1 bilh\u00e3o.\n\nAcredito com total convic\u00e7\u00e3o que USELESS ser\u00e1 um dos 5 principais memecoins antes do fim deste ciclo,\ne que sua subida para mais de US$ 1 bilh\u00e3o acontecer\u00e1 muito mais r\u00e1pido e com muito mais for\u00e7a do que a maioria imagina.\n\nSE DEUS QUISER.",

      "text": "some objective thoughts about #USELESS coin here\n\nlet me start by highlighting two key things:\n\n1. i'm unfazed by whatever dips we have on the coin right now or in the short term. targets remain unchanged: billions and billions, God willing\n\n2. i acknowledge that i might have gotten too aggressive in my short-term bullposting, especially with giving short-term targets\n\nthat said, nothing about my thesis for USELESS coin has changed\n\nif anything, this pullback is a healthy one that actually puts USELESS coin in a better position to rocket to billions in market cap, for a number of reasons:\n\n1. USELESS ran from $4.2 million to $420 million market cap in 7 weeks: that's 100x, in one of the worst environments for on-chain and trench trading in a long time, where barely anything is moving! some profit-taking by people who are up bigly isn\u2019t unnatural. if anything, it\u2019s healthy and will result in less sell pressure on the next leg up, which would allow the move to be much higher\n\n2. a lot of whales, big money, and KOLs got sidelined on that rally from $4.2m to $420m and didn\u2019t feel comfortable getting into USELESS because they thought it was a fad that lacked staying power. the higher it went, the clearer it became to them that it\u2019s here to stay. the key question for them became: where to buy without necessarily buying the \u2018local top\u2019? i think this pullback makes it more attractive for them to size in\n\n3. i know for sure that a lot of top CEXs want to list. timing-wise, it would probably be easier overall for them to list after a cooldown from a parabolic rally. and these CEXs will play a key role in ensuring USELESS goes mainstream and hits the multi-billion-dollar market cap it's destined for by making it incredibly easy for retail to access it\n\nwith the above said, i remain strongly bullish on USELESS coin on all timeframes\n\nUSELESS has so far corrected 45% from its $420m ATH and bounced on strong support around $230m market cap\n\nare there odds that it has bottomed? highly likely!\n\ncould it maybe go down a bit more? maybe, but this does not invalidate my bullish bias\n\nmany have highlighted the eerie similarity between the early FARTCOIN chart and the USELESS coin chart today btw\n\nthis was something i also highlighted early on when USELESS coin was around $10m market cap and everyone was trying to FUD it to death... just before it started its parabolic rally\n\ni.e., FARTCOIN initially ran from nothing to around $440m, consolidated for a bit around the $300m\u2013$400m range, pulled back to around $200m where it consolidated for a while, before starting its next explosive leg up to $2.7 billion\n\nidk whether or not the exact same reality plays out for USELESS coin, but so far i\u2019ve found the similarities uncannily chilling\n\nofc, this kind of move isn\u2019t unique to just FARTCOIN fwiw. it has happened for several other top memecoins that hit multi-billions before FARTCOIN\n\nmy thesis for this, based on personal observations and confluence with a lot of memecoin savants, is this: new on-chain memecoins tend to face heavy resistance around the $300 million market cap mark, but outperformers (like FARTCOIN, USELESS, etc.) often push a bit higher initially due to hype and attention (hence the initial $400m+ level for both). then they pull back to around $200m as many who missed the initial rally start bidding hard to get exposure\n\nofc, several people have pointed out these similarities so i\u2019m not the first to observe them, which means certain levels could be front-run, but the key thing is: the end result is the same\n\nso even if USELESS dips a bit more, it doesn\u2019t invalidate my bullish bias. same happened with FARTCOIN at similar levels in its early days\n\ni wouldn\u2019t recommend day trading this fwiw. i haven\u2019t really seen anyone make a fortune day trading memecoins\n\nthe best game plan for those who are sidelined and believe that 1) this bull run is not over, 2) USELESS coin is going to billions, or for those who are not satisfied with their current exposure, is to start sizing in or DCA to increase their stack\n\nofc, whatever you do, it\u2019s up to you \u2014 your trade, your responsibility, your liability, etc\n\nhowever, coins like USELESS are a trader\u2019s dream: massive volatility both to the upside and downside\n\nwhen it pumps, it pumps the hardest and outperforms everything\n\nwhen it corrects, it also does that aggressively... often to the point where it gives the impression that it\u2019s done and holders + sideliners start doubting its potential \u2014 then it pulls the next aggressive leg up, in a way that leaves many sidelined as it rockets to new ATHs\n\nregardless of short-term price action here, my conviction remains:\n\nUSELESS coin is going to billions and billions\n\nGOD WILLING",

      "text": "#USELESS coin just hit a new ATH in number of on-chain holders\n\nit has gained an additional 1,282 holders since my last update a few days ago\n\nwhile a lot of new holders joining USELESS is bullish, it's even more impressive when you consider that this growth happened during a marketwide downtrend, while an army of tier 1 fudders continues to unleash their fury on it and the $BONK ecosystem\n\nthe one thing this makes clear is this: marketwide downtrend or not, aggressive FUD or not, there is strong appetite for USELESS coin, as many continue to believe it is the next bluechip memecoin narrative with mainstream potential\n\nwhen you couple this with the following:\n\n- whales and smart money continuing to accumulate\n- top holders and the early group of core holders continuing to hold strong or add more\n- spot and perps volume holding strong both on-chain and on CEXs\n- USELESS continuing to be the fastest horse at the slightest sign of strength in the market, as well as the best proxy for betting on risk-on\n\nit's not hard to see that USELESS coin is the next multi-billion memecoin!\n\nGOD WILLING",

      "text": "the #USELESS coin FUD on the timeline as of late reminds me of the following engagement in late May\n\nUSELESS ended up dipping slightly more and consolidating for an additional two weeks\n\nall while the FUD intensified and an army of people assassinated my character and aggressively attacked the BonkFun eco and even $BONK as a project\n\nonly for USELESS to pull a monster rally from $4.2m to $420m in a few weeks\n\nand that rally remains the most explosive we've seen from any memecoin all year!\n\ntbh i'm surprised that USELESS has held this well against the backdrop of FUD and personal attacks that have been launched at it over the past week\n\n'chang-fudder' is also no longer chang-fudder because he repented and bought USELESS at a much higher market cap after he saw the light\n\nand then apologized to me in a group chat after he was up a lot of money on the trade\n\nas i said at the time, sometimes all you need to do is zoom out and look at the big picture\n\nUSELESS coin is simply the best narrative to emerge from the trenches all year, possibly even all cycle\n\nand this so-called 'dip' will look like a blip on the radar in the not-so-distant future\n\nGOD WILLING",

      "text": "this is spot on! \ud83d\udcaf\ud83c\udfaf\n\n$USELESS has literally consolidated in the $200m - $400m range for 60 days now\n\nmany have had a full two months to shove whatever size they want into #USELESS coin and chill as it speed runs to multi-billions\n\nyet they will fade it now and start screaming 'cabal pump' when it makes the inevitable move to multi-billions\n\nthis reminds me of the early days of USELESS, just before its parabolic move from $4.2m to $420m: it first ran from zero to $40m, pulled back hard to $4.2m lows, and for weeks almost anyone could\u2019ve bought good size under $10m\n\nmany faded it instead, then got salty and started claiming it only pumped because of a cabal or 'crime'\n\ni can see the same playing out again soon\n\nliterally everything aligns for USELESS coin to pull a monster rally to multi-billions soon:\n\n1. it is the strongest memecoin narrative to emerge from the trenches all cycle:\n\n- $DOGE? it's a USELESS coin!\n- $PEPE? it's a USELESS coin!\n- $FARTCOIN? it's a USELESS coin!\n- $SPX? it's a USELESS coin!\n- tens of millions of other memecoins? they're all USELESS coins!\n\n2. USELESS emerged during a very dark period for the trenches, when many considered it dead, gave life to the trenches, and then pulled a monster 100x rally to $420 million in mere weeks\n\nalmost every major memecoin this cycle has emerged eerily similar circumstances:\n\n- $BONK launched after the FTX implosion when many considered crypto dead for good\n- $PEPE launched at a time many believed memecoins are dead forever\n\nthere's a reason why many tend to be sidelined in these memecoins in their early days: nobody believed a runner could emerge at those times, resulting in them getting disproportionate hate which then fuels an aggressive, hated rally to multi-billions\n\nthis kind of environment gives a coin massive advantages: \n\n1) only super strong, sticky narratives can thrive in this kind of environment\n2) the usual pump and dump tourists tend to be sidelined, resulting in better price action\n3) early believers who got in during difficult times like this tend to be genuine believers and holders rather than dumpers\n\n3. $SOL looks poised for an aggressively explosive rally, which should revive the trenches and fuel a monster memecoin rally\n\ni've been calling for an aggressive SOL rally for a while now, which is starting to play out\n\ni believe the real move will start soon, and trending SOL memecoins like USELESS will be the biggest beneficiaries\n\nSOL DATs (Digital Asset Treasuries) will start going live starting next month, which should fuel a SOL rally to ATHs and beyond\n\nwe already saw how these DATs played out for $BTC and $ETH, but the SOL move will make the BTC and ETH rallies look like a child's play in comparison\n\nand i think USELESS coin is uniquely positioned to be the biggest beneficiary from this Solana move:\n\n- shiny new memecoin that just got listed on Coinbase\n- ridiculously low market cap relative to other established memecoins that will help it pump more aggressively\n- hottest narrative of the cycle: everyone will have no choice but to talk about a \u2018USELESS coin\u2019 (??!!!) being a top-100 crypto or pumping over 100% in a day when that inevitably happens \u2014 and that attention will only create more exposure, pumping it even harder\n\n4. two-month long consolidation will ensure aggressive explosion\n\nthe longer the consolidation, the more aggressive the move\n\ntbh i expected USELESS to have left this range before now, but experience has taught me that the longer the consolidation, the more aggressive the move\n\nwhen USELESS breaks out of this range, it's going to break out aggressively\n\n5. the Coinbase premium\n\nif you exclude $TRUMP, the memecoin of the President of the United States, USELESS is literally the only memecoin launched this year that\u2019s been listed on Coinbase\n\nliterally 100M+ Americans can now buy $USELESS, just as we\u2019re about to enter the perfect storm: SOL going explosive on infinite DAT bids, the Fed cutting rates to fuel risk appetite, and a Q4 seasonality bid that generally favors crypto and risk\n\nno other memecoin that launched this year has this advantage!\n\nthe liquidity that will send USELESS won\u2019t be the usual stale, PvP, hyper-rotational trenches liquidity that\u2019s made it hard for any true blue chip memecoin to emerge this past year \u2014 it will be pure, unadulterated normie liquidity, that only a platform like Coinbase can unlock\n\nlike it or hate it, USELESS is the chosen one when all factors are considered\u2026 and everything is aligning to fuel its aggressively explosive, mother-of-all rallies\n\nwe're all gonna make it\n\nGOD WILLING",

      "text": "so much crying about $USELESS coin on the timeline today\n\nsome even went as far as to suggest i was selling because i was AFK for less than two days, even though i'm technically more affected by the drawdown than most \u2014 and it can easily be verified on-chain that i haven't sold a token!\n\ni guess i'll start taking more frequent breaks going forward!\n\nif your thesis for a coin is so weak that a single guy being offline for a couple days is enough to shake your conviction or make you panic sell, then you're a manchild and should reassess your reason for investing in the first place. respectfully \ud83e\udee1\n\nokay, rant\u2019s done.\n\nhow am i feeling about USELESS here?\n\non a personal level: 1) never sold a token 2) still holding my low-leverage, short-term swing trade from around the Coinbase listing because i expected higher targets, so i simply added more margin 3) longed more on this dip today as i found it irresistible\n\ngenerally speaking, my conviction remains unshaken:\n\n- the thesis for USELESS coin remains intact, so i have zero reason to panic\n\n- i believe the major move for memecoins this cycle is NOT yet in, and i expect USELESS to outperform when that move inevitably comes\n\n- while many might be obsessively focused on the USELESS price action, it currently has a much better drawdown-from-ATH ratio than most established or hyped newer memecoins\n\nfor example:\n\n- USELESS is down 63% from ATH\n- FARTCOIN is down 75%\n- PEPE is down 68%\n- WIF is down 85%\n\ni could go on and on!\n\nmemecoins are known for their insane volatility on both sides: they often rally or correct harder than even the most optimistic or pessimistic estimates of the average holder\n\nwhat ultimately matters is whether the underlying thesis or fundamentals have changed\n\nUSELESS coin\u2019s main thesis can never change:\n\n- there\u2019s an entire sector of useless coins ('memecoins') worth $70 billion\n- there\u2019s an individual useless cryptocurrency worth over $160 billion i.e. $XRP\n- there are dozens of useless coins with market caps in the billions or tens of billions i.e. $ADA, $BCH, $LTC, etc\n- by contrast, $USELESS sits around $160m at the time of writing\n\nUSELESS coin\u2019s fundamentals have also improved significantly:\n\n1. it is now available on Coinbase, Kraken, and several major CEXs at a price attractive enough to onboard a new wave of believers\n\n2. Kraken now holds ~4.5% of supply, and CEX balances continue to rise through this dip \u2014 indicative of retail accumulation\n\n3. whales and smart money continue to accumulate aggressively, showing conviction in its potential\n\n4. on-chain volume looks strong, accelerating during this correction \u2014 showing dips are being bought\n\n5. core early holders remain steadfast. a notable example is @duaud9912 (second-biggest individual holder) doubling down on the dip earlier today: nitter.net/duaud9912/status/19624\u2026\n\n6. several high-profile traders with massive reach (e.g. @Bluntz_Capital, @MacroCRG, @AltcoinSherpa) have long flagged the $0.160 level as a key level for them to get bullish on it. i didn\u2019t want USELESS to hit it, but here we are \u2014 and these guys being on board helps decentralize the holder base and further amplify the message\n\n7. USELESS mindshare remains strong, evidenced by today\u2019s surge in accounts posting about it \u2014 whether buying the dip, memeing the price action, or outright fudding. all of this adds up to creating more awareness, which is bullish\n\n8. brutal dips like this tend to strengthen a project\u2019s core community if they survive it. USELESS has a major edge in surviving compared to any other memecoin launched this year\n\noverall, everyone wants high-potential assets to go straight up without catching a break\n\nbut that\u2019s not how markets work\n\nsometimes our assets defy expectations for a while \u2014 other times the market just does what markets do. and that\u2019s fine!\n\nat the end of the day, you only need to ask yourself two questions:\n\n1. do you think this bull run is over, and memecoins will never go explosive again?\n\n2. has anything about the core thesis or narrative of USELESS changed because of this dip?\n\nfor me, the answer to both is no\n\nif anything, this correction makes the meme funnier and pulls in an army of people who have to talk about it just to be part of the \u201cUSELESS joke\u201d\n\nbut talk about it they must \u2014 and that attention fuels higher upside once momentum returns, thanks to the mindshare boost this dip has created\n\nTLDR: my faith in USELESS coin remains unshaken, and the trajectory remains multi-billions. God willing!",
