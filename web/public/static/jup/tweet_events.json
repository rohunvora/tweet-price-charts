We will take a month to regroup, improve the platform.\n\nIn addition, I shared a few key ideas around a global composable atomic market, open stock exchange and the great meta migration - and i want to build these on Solana n i know we have the best ecosystem and community possible to build it.\n\nFor crypto culture, I will make sure I own up to anything i did not do as well as possible, and not be defensive or evasive if questioned. I am also sorry that if i get overly snappy or have mean quips sometimes, but you have to remember deep in this cat is an internet troll that needs to come out now and then. :D\n\nLastly, i owe a ton of people their thanks, have been overdue on that, so do it shortly. \n\nSo yup, no more replies to fud or snappy tweets - we will get back to being 100% product, community and ecosystem focused, with detailed essays and livestreams where we explain things in clear detail.\n\nBest Product\nBest Community\nBest Ecosystem\n\nSo much love to everyone who was part of the process. Seriously, thanks.\n\nM",

      "text": "Jupiter: Let's Go!\n\nHello space catdets! Over the last few months, we built a robust community of catdets with a common vision, scaled up our infrastructure to handle many levels of volume, tested a lot of things together, and overcame a hell lot of adversity together.\n\nAnd now, we are ready to start the next phase of our journey - going to Jupiter as fellow space catdets, because that's where the meta is!\n\nOver the month of Feb, we will kick off the key J.U.P. initiative, product updates and introducing launchpad candidates to the community.  These includes:\n\n1. Initializing the DAO with operational funds and participation incentives\n2. Introducing the first set of LFG candidates to the community\n3. Rolling out a series of updates across our product lines\n\nBut before we get started, as any good space catdet would know, logistics comes first, then plans, then next steps.\n\nLaunchpool Logistics\nOver the past 7 days, our DLMM Launch Pool has been stabilizing wild price swings and allowing airdrop recipients and early buyers to sell into the pool if they choose to.\n\nHowever, this pool is not good for price discovery, due to the buy and sell walls on both sides. This position was supposed to be there for 3 days, however uncertainty in the Launch Pool mechanism led to the decision to extend this to 7 days, for retail holders and buyers to learn more about the launch pool mechanism\n\nAt the time of writing, our liquidity position is approximately 96,164,550.29 JUP and 69,927,955.07 USDC.\n\n1. As communicated, the 96M JUP tokens will be removed and sent to cold multisig immediately.\n2.  USDC will be removed in $10M batches, starting today, over the next few months.\n\nThis will allow the JUP to regain price discovery while assuring all participants that the team is committed to a long-term gradual withdrawal of USDC liquidity.\n\nJ.U.P.: Jupiter United Planet!\n\nJupiter has 3 key components:\n1. Jup.ag -> the best exchange in defi\n2. $JUP -> the governance token for jupiter and symbol for defi 2.0\n3. J.U.P -> where all catdets, ecosystem working group and the DAO lives\n\nAfter spending years on jup.ag, last few months on launching $JUP, our core focus now turns to building up the third component - J.U.P, which is a combination of the community, an effective working group and the DAO, because it is the combination of these 3 aspects that we can truly have a decentralized community that is also\n\nJupiter DAO\nThe goal for the Jupiter DAO is to incrementally evolve it into the most dynamic, most productive and proactive DAO in space - moving not just Jupiter forward, but also Solana and crypto.\n\nThis is possible because Jupiter has an extremely broad holder base, is the most used trading platform and has no collective voting blocks. And of course, we catdets have a common, sincere vision in helping bring the decentralized meta forward.\n\nThe JUP DAO initially would focus on evaluating and approving launchpad projects, ratify budgets for working groups, approve grants, and release budgets for ongoing community and ecosystem initiatives.\n\nTo encourage participation in the DAO, the entirety of the launchpad fees earned from the JUP launch (100M JUP) will be allocated to governance participants over the course of the first 6 months to a year, in the form of governance incentives.\n\nTo cover initial operational needs of the DAO (including working group budget), 75% of all DLMM fees will be transferred to the DAO. For example, the JUP DLMM pool earned 8.2M in USDC, of which 6.15M USDC will be given to the DAO for operational needs.\n\nnitter.net/weremeow/status/175376\u2026\n\nTherefore, the DAO will start with approximately 100M in JUP for participation incentives from  and about 7M in operational funds from DLMM fees.\n\nOn an ongoing basis, launchpad fees from LFG projects will  be distributed to governance participants as well, while DLMM swap fees will be allocated for operational needs.\n\nThere are a very large number of details to cover here, including voting/locking mechanisms, participation reward distribution, and also clear documentation of fund transfers, so we will discuss as a community how to move forward on this, tho we expect to see this set up and voting started before the end of Feb.\n\nWe are extremely excited about the above, since the DAO will now have the capital, incentives and mandate to really drive a lot of initiatives and ideas forward.\n\nWhile the DAO is obviously the center of attention, we will need to have a very strong working arm and a community to back it up. As such, we will be introducing the Jupiter ecosystem working group and a special catdet role and channel in discord.\n\nThese are all things that we have been working extremely hard on setting up behind the scenes over the last few months, and super excited to roll it out!\n\nLFG Candidates\n\nLFG is our initiative to grow the pie by helping great projects get the awareness, community and users to thrive in the long term. It is therefore crucial to remember that LFG is a community initiative - the team should play NO ROLE in deciding if a project is suitable to be launched.\n\nIt is up to the community to vet, discuss and decide if a project should be launched on the LFG platform.\n\nTo kick off early discussion in this initiative, we are bringing 3 OG projects to the community to introduce themselves, share their plans and potentially launch their tokens.\n\n@sanctumso  is building an infinite-LST future, tapping into innovative liquidity sources to drive liquid staking and DeFi. With experience building the first SPL program used by stake pools, and liquidity sources like unstake.it. They are currently building the most capital-efficient LST liquidity pool known as Infinity, with the goal of turning all staked SOL liquid.\n\n@SharkyFi  is a top NFT collateralization platform on Solana, allowing NFT holders to borrow and lend against NFTs to acquire leverage or earn yields. Born on Solana, Sharky is expanding to other chains (EVM & BRC20) and asset classes (RWA/DeFi) and tap into new underserved markets. They are expected to complete BRC-20, EVM deployments, alongside new offerings for RWAs and Mortgages by the end of 2024.\n\n@deBridgeFinance provides cross-chain infrastructure that brings the most powerful bridging experience. Users can trade assets across chains in seconds, without wrapped assets or liquidity pools. Their 0-TVL design drastically limits attack surface, and reduces the incentives necessary to bootstrap a bridge. This empowered them to build DLN, a cross-chain exchange that taps into liquidity everywhere.\n\nOver the next 2 weeks, we will be introducing these projects to the community via a variety of channels, including a townhall, a special channel for each project, and twitter summaries as well.\n\nFor other projects that wish to be involved, there will also be a channel to apply as well, so please keep a lookout for that as well! \n\nAgain, we aim to be as inclusive as possible, so it is very important that there is a channel for everyone to easily apply and participate as well.\n\nLast but not least\u2026.\n\nI want to be emo here and say a huge massive thanks to the team, community and ecosystem supporters who have been extremely supportive in the past few weeks. It would have been completely impossible to do any of these without the heart, soul and love everyone has been pouring into this. Going to Jupiter is a task that requires the collective efforts of an entire united community, and I am extremely grateful to be taking part in this journey with everyone.\n\nAs explained previously, our strategy at Jupiter is very cat brained and simple:\n\nBest product\nBest community\nBest memes\nBest ecosystem\nBest team\n\nWe can do this.\nLet's go!\n\nLove,\nM",

      "text": "Now that the launch period is over, my main focus in the coming weeks is going to be kickstarting the third crucial component of Jupiter - Jupiter United Planet (J.U.P.) \n\nJ.U.P represents the core community of Jupiter, and will have 3 main aspects:\n\n1. Space Catdets: For proactive, helpful community members interested in improving Jupiter and advancing the meta\n\n2. Ecosystem Working Group: An inclusive group of community leaders working on key ecosystem projects like token lists and facilitating grants, LFG projects. This group will be funded by the Jupiter DAO.\n\n3. Jupiter DAO: Initial mandate for the DAO will be to drive Jupiter, Solana and the meta forward. One of the first set of things the DAO will do will be to approve LFG projects and approve working group and other budgets.\n\nWe will have the new catdet role today in Discord, while the working group will be announced tmr, while we will also be looking to start discussing DAO formation and start LFG applications next week as well.\n\ndiscord.gg/jup\n\ni know it has been an extremely bumpy and difficult ride so far, but I am super looking forward to working with everyone to kickstart this new journey with!",

      "text": "LFG Launchpad Voting Will Start Next Week! \n\nBesides the airdrop and launchpool mechanisms, LFG is also pioneering a launchpad process where the community takes a leading role in discussing, vetting, voting and performing post-launch analysis together. \n\nSince applications begun a couple of weeks ago, more than 20 great teams have applied via public introduction posts on the forum. Many have received strong support and feedback from the Jupiter community and even seeing strong growth as a result.\n\njupresear.ch/c/lfg-intros\n\nBased on factors including community sentiment, project readiness for TGE, and due diligence, the Core Work Group (CWG) has introduced 6 of these projects more intimately to the community via dedicated Discord forum posts and AMA sessions.\n\nAnd today, we are happy to share that we are ready to kick off DAO voting for next week for the first batch of LFG launches!\n\nFirst LFG DAO Vote \n\nDuring the week of March 4th, the Jupiter DAO will vote on the first 2 projects to be launched from a technical maximum of 10 projects. The launch window for these projects will be between late March to mid April. \n\nThe CWG will aim to provide the voters with crucial succinct information from community feedback and AMA, to assist in decision-making by the DAO.\n\nKey Notes:\n- This will be a token-weighted vote in which DAO participants pick their favorite option from a list of candidates\n- The 2 projects that receive the most votes are considered to be formally \u2018approved by the DAO\u2019, with the #1 project having priority in choosing their launch date.\n- If a project is not in the top 2, it is not a rejection. They can participate in future votes\n- Between launches, there will be a minimum 2 week gap \n\nGiven that this will be the first-ever LFG vote, some aspects will change with time based on community feedback to ensure we progress towards a more solidified process.\n\nDesign Goals\n\n1. Voting: The 2 slots per month forces the DAO to pick the projects that they really want, rather than voting for everything to earn tokens. \n\n2. Incentives: While the exact distribution mechanism has not been decided, 75% of launchpad fees (including the 100M JUP from the JUP launch) will be distributed to voters to increase turnout. \n\n3. Alignment: The voting incentives will not be distributed immediately, likely with a minimum vesting period of 3-6 months. There are 3 key reasons behind this:\n\n- It builds greater alignment between the Jupiter community and the project for months post launch\n- Voters will vote based on what is likely to generate value over time and have the most long-term potential\n- It will not increase the immediate circulating supply, a major concern for projects\n\n4. Timing: There are multiple stakeholders involved, such as the projects, team and the voters. Timing has to be taken into account to ensure that projects are given sufficient headsup to plan their LFG launch, or find alternatives. Voters require sufficient time to deliberate and review, and launches have to be spaced out sufficiently to maximize impact and minimize fatigue.\n\n5. Transparency: Transparency has been a key priority from day 1. The launchpad applications are transparent to everyone on the Jupiter research forum allowing for community impact instead of other traditionally closed processes. \n\nCWG as Facilitators\n\nThe Core Working Group will not focus on evaluation, but rather ensure that important community feedback is effectively presented to the project(s).\n\nInstead of forcing every community member to exhaustively evaluate each project from start to finish, the CWG works synergistically with the DAO to present them with high-density information. \n\nThis includes the AMAs, which are the culmination of everything talked about up until that point, and the introduction process, which moves a project to the \u2018candidacy\u2019 stage. This ensures that the DAO is able to make informed decisions, while everyone still has access to all the raw data.\n\nThe CWG has the right to decide not to hold any votes in the extreme case that they feel there are no suitable candidates at the time, and will openly address these concerns within a town hall to the community. \n\nLastly, while the CWG ran the important process of deciding which projects to introduce at a deeper level so far, moving forward it will likely be a much more collaborative process with the catdets taking on a key role in terms of who they want to hear from next.\n\nBy co-creating these processes with the community, we stay in tune with the catdets and receive critical feedback about how to best mold them over time. Like a living organism has individual cells, we grow and we do so together as a whole.\n\nJUP DAO\n\nOne crucial part of making this work is that JUP is highly distributed, sufficiently valuable, very liquid, and, most importantly, has no insider voting blocs. \n\nAlong with the fact that voting is incentivized to gather sufficient interest, we believe that it will be difficult for any single party to swing the vote towards any one participant.\n\nLFG: A Pragmatic, Optimistic Experiment\n\nAt Breakpoint 2023, we discussed the Jupiter launchpad as a much needed approach to \u2018grow the pie\u2019 by giving great projects exposure, funding, and community support. \n\n4 months in, and after many public trials of fire later, I am delighted that we are finally ready to move to next affirmative step of helping great projects launch too.\n\nAt its core, LFG is a pragmatic but ultimately optimistic experiment. \n\nThe pessimistic view is that community decision making is short sighted, that they will vote for whatever benefits them in the short term without consideration for long-term ecosystem health, and that most will not read or will seek to blame rather than learn.\n\nWe prefer to take the other side of the argument. We believe that with well-designed incentives, iteratively evolved processes, and well-presented community-sourced data points, the community as a whole (users, catdets, DAO) can indeed make the best decisions, be supportive of projects, and, most importantly, learn together.\n\nNow let\u2019s jump in, eyes wide open, and pioneer this shit together! \n\nMeow!\n\nPS: Big thanks to the following:\n\n1) To the CWG - whose relentless and immensely inspiring desire to do well for the community and ecosystem got us to this point. They are also co-authors of this piece. - @kemos4be, @slorgoftheslugs, @c2yptic @durdenwannabe \ud83e\udee1\n\n2) To the amazing catdets - LFG is impossible without an extremely strong community, and the catdets have shown incredible support for the projects, processes, and team. \ud83d\udc08\n\n3) To the super patient projects - We know how important your token launch is to you, and we are super grateful to be part of the process.  We will do everything we can to help you for long term success. \ud83d\ude4f\n\nWe are trying to make this the most transparent and hopefully effective launchpad possible for you, the ecosystem, and crypto. Thanks for joining us on this journey! \u2764\ufe0f",

      "text": "J.U.P: Jupiter United Planet \n\nJ.U.P is our vision for how we can build a unique, highly productive, dynamic and synergistic community to move Jupiter and crypto forward.\n\nThe 75 readers of my essays know that I have been riffing on J.U.P for a while now, but with things are finally coming into focus.\n\nWith the DAO coming up next week. it is a good time to explain we are emphasizing it now, explain what it is and why it is one of the 3 core strategies of Jupiter.\n\nFirst Phase Of Jup: Product Focused Project \n\nFor the first phase of Jupiter, we were mainly a product focused project, which means the bulk of the interactions and focus was between the users of the platform as well as the team.\n\nThis interaction was anchored by the Jup.ag promise of \"best price, best selection, best ux\", as well as a relentless best in class commitment to user support and feedback. This includes users of our developer tools, which we spent insane amounts of time making sure works as well as possible.\n\nThat extremely synergistic relationship and trust between the team and users, built up over a number of years, was the foundation for all the progress we made towards becoming the one of the, if not the best product in defi. \n\nCurrent Phase: Full Stack Ecosystem Push\n\nWe are currently pushing to transform from a single-product play to a full-stack ecosystem play with the strategic vision of accelerating the decentralized meta. \n\nBesides the launchpad, we intend to execute on a full range of ecosystem efforts, and this efforts will need distributed networks of talented people working in parallel with very different skillsets, agendas driven under a common goal.\n\nWhat is J.U.P\n\nOver the past few years, i have observed certain important dynamics about how things work - small talented groups of individuals can get a ton done but lack legitimacy and funds, the community provides immense energy and vibez but has major adhd issues, DAO confer legitimacy but needs a lot of execution support and supporting structures.\n\nJ.U.P is our attempt to manifest a holistic community that blends the best of all these into a synergistic effort to grow Jupiter and the meta forward.\n\nAs such, J.U.P has 5 key components with the following aspirations:\n\n1. Users: Reason For Our Existence\nOur dear users are the ones who relentlessly supported Jupiter through endless product reiterations and feedback, culminating in the world class product suite you see today. We would like to 10x the userbase while maintaining the same type of synergy and commitment to best in class customer service you see today.\n\n2. Team: Hard working mfers\nBuilders of the Jupiter platform. We work very hard and will continue to work hard. Hehe.\n\n3. Working Groups: Execution Engines for J.U.P\nConsisting of small groups led by key ecosystem members that lead extremely important work areas like community management, core processes, ecosystem rituals.\n\nCurrently we have 2 groups, the Core and Uplink WGs - and the community can definitely attest to how much energy and work they have already done across crucial LFG processes,  regular calls, ecosystem token lists, and communicating Jupiter and its objectives. \n\nImportantly, work groups will collaborate closely with the team, and be funded by the DAO. This dynamic ensures that the workgroups are both extremely productive AND accountable to the communiy.\n\nnitter.net/JupiterExchange/\u2026\nnitter.net/JupiterExchange/status\u2026\n\n4. Catdets: Heart of J.U.P. \nCatdets are community members who understand and embrace the long term vision of advancing the decentralized meta while keeping to key community ethos of being helpful, friendly and supportive, whether it is to fellow members newcomers and projects. \n\nSpecial shout-out to the cats of culture, who are instrumental in promoting Catdets and being the best possible examples i have ever seen of great community leadership!\n\nnitter.net/JupiterExchange/status\u2026\n\n5. DAO: \ud83e\udd14\nThis will be formed the coming week, and i cannot be more excited. I truly believe we have the potential to build the most unbiased, dynamic, proactive, widely distributed DAO in the whole of crypto with the most fun and awesome mandate.  Let's see if we make it. ;)\n\nnitter.net/weremeow/status/176274\u2026\n\nJ.U.P:  An experiment in distributed execution of strategy \n\nUltimately, like everything Jupiter does, J.U.P is another massive experiment on constructing a community. J.U.P emphasizes on the potential and capabilities of each of the 5 components, and aims to leverage them together synergistically. \n\nWe are extremely early in this experiment, and we hope you will be part of the process in forming a holistic and strong community to drive Jupiter and the meta forward!\n\nAnd last but not least, a hugeeeeeee thanks to everyone who is in J.U.P. If you are reading this, there is an pretty good chance you are in one of these categories so much love for being part of this experiment. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nM\n\nPS: It is J-dot-U-dot-P (no dot at the end)",

      "text": "J.U.P: DAO, ASR, J4J\n\nOver 180K wallets voted over the first 2 JUP DAO votes, most ever in crypto to our knowledge. With tremendous interest in the DAO & the pioneering ASR idea, it's time to share some key thoughts.\n\nAspirations\nWe want the Jupiter DAO to become the best DAO in crypto - meaning we have the most proactive and dynamic voter base, strongest ability to execute on stated plans, and importantly, able to coordinate to drive important long term directions like bringing millions more into Jupiter and into the meta.\n\nJust like how our journey to build the best product in crypto took many years, building the best DAO will be a multi-year journey as well, and one that we are super excited to embark on with everyone.\n\nIn fact, it is arguably going to be even more challenging than the build up of the Jupiter products, since building a DAO and the other structures (see J.U.P Planet) is one that needs up to hundreds of thousands of people to come together and operate in sync.\n\nUnique Amongst All DAOs\nJupiter DAO is starting with a unique set of foundational qualities unseen in any other DAO.\n\n- No insider voting blocs \n- Significant value and high liquidity \n- Highly distributed, retail heavy token holder base \n- Most used decentralized trading platform in crypto (means lots ot attention can be given to votes)\n- Massive effort is given to the voting process via WGs\n- Dynamic, forward-looking voter base who wants to expand, not shrink\n\nThis foundation allows the DAO to take on a dramatically different scope compared to all the other DAOs.\n\nExpansive Mandate\nGiven the role that Jupiter plays in the ecosystem, the overall growth of the decentralized ecosystem will naturally be of tremendous assistance to Jupiter as well. Therefore, the mandate of the DAO is not narrowly limited to Jupiter, but rather broadly focused on growing the ecosystem as well via Jupiter community and platform.\n\nEven in the first year, starting with LFG - we will see the DAO participate in a number of voting activities that will be broadly beneficial to the ecosystem, and with the advent of grants, we would like to see more ways for the ecosystem to find ideas that are leverage Jupiter to push the meta forward.\n\nStrong Operational Funding\nThe DAO will be well capitalized with at least $8M in USDC and 100M in JUP for the first 2 years of funding for the purposes of workgroup budgets and grants. The USDC will serve as an operational budget while the JUP serves as incentives and long term alignment. \n\nThis budget allows J.U.P to attract networks of the very best community talent who can execute on initiatives and ideas that grow the value of Jupiter far more than any single organization can. \n\nThe team will look into different mechanisms, including DLMM fees from the launchpad to make sure the DAO is funded sustainably over time.\n\nJUP FOR JUP\nStarting with the JUP launchpad fees from the JUP launch, we want to get JUP into the hands of those who are the most actively involved and participate actively in the Jupiter ecosystem as voters. \n\nAs a result, we developed a mechanism called ASR (Active Staking Rewards), which does not reward passive staking, but rather stakers have to actively participate, and most importantly, engage. \n\nIf the first 6 months are successful, we will replenish the ASR rewards every 6 months on an ongoing basis as part of the JUP FOR JUP - getting JUP into the hands of those actively engaged, especially in this early part of the Jupiter.\n\nJupiter is a decades long endeavor - and having the early stakeholders are soooooo important as foundation.\n\nPart of J.U.P\n\nEnd of the day, the DAO is but one part, albeit a crucial part of a well-functioning community ecosystem. If the JUP DAO becomes the best DAO, it is because it lives within the best community of catdets, users, work groups.\n\nTherefore, it is crucial that the DAO never resorts to short termed narrow thinking mindsets. \n\nInstead, we will  actively grow the J.U.P community, stock it with the absolute best talent we can find, and courageously bring millions more into the Jupiter family, and into the meta.\n\nBesides, what else are we here for? ;)\n\n\ud83e\ude77 \nMeow",

      "text": "Our decision to help out the sloth participants with ~100K of $SLERF from LO/DCA fees was understandably divisive, with several people pointing out that this would encourage the exact behaviors that we should be trying to eradicate. \n\n(To be 100% clear, No JUP is involved in this process. )\n\nI completely understand that sentiment, and would like to provide more context on how we see the situation.\n\nFirst off, this is not an endorsement of either the project nor the methods being used in the presale. No one in the ecosystem thinks this mechanism is good in any way shape of form. In fact, we (along w many other projects) are actively developing better bootstrapping mechanisms for new meme coins and projects.\n\nSecondly, I reserve my judgement on whether it was a marketing stunt. I do not have any insight on that whatsoever, so my priority is not based on that, but rather based on how we can emerge from this situation  better and stronger.\n\nGiven this, we did so primarily because many participants in this presale are new to the ecosystem, and I am quite sure they learnt an important lesson here already given the intense coverage over the last few days.\n\nIt is my opinion that we should present a united front of the Solana ecosystem as one that is helpful and supportive to newcomers and solve problems when they come up.\n\nLastly on our end, we will ensure that any funds will not be for the developers, but rather be for the affected users. If the donation hits the target. we can also help with setting up a claimpad to make sure donations reach the right sad sloths.\n\nI want to emphasize that this is a one-off thing, and we as an ecosystem need to work hard to develop better mechanisms n norms prevent this from happening again.\n\nFor now, tho, we are down to help how we can. In the midst of the bull, it is easy to forget how raw and tender the market is from the last brutal cycle. No doubt, lessons are important, but sometimes, we gonna tend to the wounds first. \n\nPS: Sorry once again if our decision to be part of rubbed some people the wrong way. I completely understand the sentiment, and once again, this is an one off effort and not an endorsement whatsoever.",

      "text": "Jupiter: Technical Issues & Incoming Upgrades\n\nOver the last few months, we have working hard behind the scenes for a series of infrastructure, process and ux upgrades to scale and harden the myraid number of systems that run Jupiter.\n\nRecent Issues\nThe urgency of these efforts really became apparent in the last month, as several key issues emerged:\n\n1. Severe lag in picking up new tokens and markets\n2. Perps/JLP not functioning well due to oracle issues*\n3. Transaction submission issues due to spam\n4. Quote API lag due to overloading\n5. Long wait times for strict list verification \n\nRoot Issues\nThese stem from a range of root issues, including but not limited to:\n1. Solana network congestion causing onchain oracles to become stale and difficulties in creating the needed token accounts for our routing\n2. Spamming of our RPC endpoints causing user txns to fail\n3. Massive explosion in the number of tokens, markets being created\n4. Spam tokens with overlapping names\n5. Huge increase in the number of strict list applications, requiring hours everyday for team and cwg to filter through\n\nComing Upgrades\nTo tackle these issues, we are working on a series of major updates:\n1. Metropolis: A total redesign of our markets and token system, ranging from the backend to frontend systems \n2. Ecosystem token list: A rethink of the current strict list approach, looping in both data and the community to help filter out the right tokens\n3. Oracle solutions: Reducing our reliance on onchain oracle option\n4. Submission options: Both optimizing our backend txn submissions and also giving users more power on the frontend\n5. Much improved observability: Having a set of full of metrics to understand and observe our systems at various levels\n\nWe will start rolling out the first of these efforts, starting with Metropolis tomorrow. Note that these efforts are on top of extensive upgrades that we had already done in preparation for the JUP launch. \n\n<3\nLast but not least, we understand that many users, partners and traders leverage our platform in a large number of ways on a daily basis, and i would like to apologize for any inconvenience caused by these issues and especially if we have been slow to respond to them due to the overwhelming workload.\n\nWe are incredibly grateful to everyone's support and feedback, and will strive to be more communicative, have faster feedback channels and explain important decisions way ahead of time.\n\nThanks again for everyone's support - we are nothing without our users, community and ecosystem, and we will try to make everything better for everyone. \n\nM\n\n* @sssionggg addressed the perps issues extensively in the last planetary call, and will be posting an elaborate update very soon.",

      "text": "How Jup.ag Protects You From MEV\n\nThe recent memecoin explosion and aping have lead to many users, especially newer ones simply setting high slippage to get trades through.\n\nWhen you use jup.ag, you get MEV protection in a few important ways:\n\n1. Jupiter routing:  Our best in class routing splits your trade and routes through many markets & assets to reduce your price impact in every market.  Much harder to get sandwiched due to using multiple markets and a lower loss per successful sandwich.\n\n2. Conservative Auto Slippage (Beta): Our UI has always had conservative slippage settings, and we are adding to that effort with our auto-slippage, which protects users from set exceedingly high slippage just to land txns. Auto slippage automatically computes a conservative slippage setting, based on the input and output token and size. This feature is still in beta, but will be improved and rolled out fully soon.\n\n3. Reputable RPCs: RPCs can see your transactions before it reaches the chain. We use only 2 reputable RPCs on the front-end to minimize the probability that the RPC is leaking transactions.  We are also currently bootstrapping our own validator, which will further improve our infrastructure capabilities to land transactions quickly for our users. This would also reduce the time your transaction is vulnerable to sandwich attackers.\n\n4. UI protections:  When users set slippage that is too high, the Jupiter UI prompts a warning to the user and suggests a lower slippage range of 0.5% - 5%. When you receive a quote on Jup.ag, the UI does a sanity check against birdeye\u2019s prices to make sure the rate you are getting is reasonable. If not, the UI prompts a confirmation.\n\n5. Tighter Direct Routing Slippage Settings: Lastly, our new direct routing mechanism (for very new tokens) also has relatively conservative conservative slippage settings while still being reasonable for transactions to get through.\n\n6. Testing In Edge: We\u2019re also testing Jito tipping in edge.jup.ag which directly send transactions to validators. This would further hide your transactions from malicious actors. We expect this to be up soon.\n\nIn summary, we work very hard at various parts of the stack to protect users from unnecessary MEV attacks, while of course allowing them to overwrite all these settings if they desire. \n\nMEV and sandwiching is a major problem in defi today, and we will be doing more detailed analysis and explainers in the coming days to help everyone understand this as much as possible.",

      "text": "Jupiter Trial Work Groups: Thoughts And Next Steps\n\nTLDR: CONGRATS TO TRIAL WGS & LETS GO!\n\n1/ JWGs are focking important for extending the capability and scope of the Jupiverse, and I am committed to spending as much time/effort as needed to figure out both the creation and accountability processes alongside the community and other WGs.\n\n2/ JWGs, just 99% of things we do, are still experiments. There are lots we need to figure out as a community across the entire stack - from formation, figuring out emergent talents, how to do community level assessments, best operational practises for the dao, etc.\n\nWe will continue to scope experiments such that potential harm is low, learn rapidly from them, apply the lessons, and move forward fast. We will not be a community that is stuck in ideas or philosophy or quagmire.\n\n3/ JWGs do wayyyyy more than just moderators - they are in essence political startups - expected to rally the community towards collaborating with them in initiatives and content creation, commit substantial amounts of time to working in public, generate strong value for the ecosystem via their efforts, and stand up for themselves and their work in public.\n\nWe need leaders, not moderators. A big part of the process is in emerging new leaders, assessing them as a community, and empowering them in terms of capital, legitimacy and support. We need to nail this process, not just for Jupiter, but as a new working model for the decentralized world.\n\n4/ The team did not personally know any of the candidates this time round, current candidates emerged via active participation from the community. For future trial workgroups, aspiring work groups should have a history of doing great work together, as well as clear broad support from the community and a focused scope before going on trial.\n\nTo be clear, i don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with this particular process, we had to move forward given that we have been talking about it for a couple of months, and this exact process was needed to figure out how to further improve it and make future trial cycles more community driven.\n\n4/ For now, we need to move past the differences and move on with a united front towards growing the Jupiverse - there is so much to do together as a community. As one of the leading communities and platforms in the decentralized world, we cannot be bogged down and get stuck via infighting.\n\nAt the same time, obviously - the differences are very real, some of the critiques very correct, and some of the improvements suggested very much needed. So we will do both - move on  to grow the Jupivere while addressing the key concerns that many have floated.\n\n5/ So, let\u2019s give the new trial working groups a big congrats for being passed by the DAO! And we will give them the time and opportunity to do the work they were voted to do. There will be 3-5 months to work with them before they are eligible to be part of the full vote.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial that we collaborate with them to the best of our ability, otherwise we are just setting them up to fail, which is the exact opposite from what we should be doing.\n\n6/ There were some key areas of concern, including trial work group formation, cost to DAO in terms of failure, voter effort in voting, prior work in terms of contribution, high pay for individuals as well as some key scandals in terms of background.\n\nThese are very important topics that are impossible to address here in a way that does justice to them, so we will work on these over the course of the next few weeks and months.\n\n7/ Last but not least, working and standing up for yourself in public is hard. Your entire self worth, work history and sometimes even how you look and various parts of identity is often put on trial.\n\nOf course, it is all par for the course, but i would encourage everyone to be kind, not to spread half baked information, and give people time to prove themselves and their intentions.\n\nTime is the best teacher, and we need to set ourselves up well to receive the lessons.\n\nEnd/ JWGs are experimental models for decentralized leadership. Figuring out the trial process is one of the crucial aspects of this experiment. We will work on figuring it out, but in the meantime, we will respect the vote, give a massive congrats to the candidates, and support them fully in the next few months.\n\nIn the meantime, we will gather all the feedback in one place, execute on improvements where necessary, encourage new areas of leadership together - and improve as a Jupiverse community together ;)\n\nAnd who knows? With some luck, we might even end up pioneering a new working model for the decentralized economy. But luck never goes to the fearful - it goes to the brave ones. So brave we will be, and take every division, debate, detractor as a chance and opportunity to learn and get better.\n\nLove, \nM",

      "text": "User Generated Money Part 3: Fulfill the Promise, Curb the abuse \n\n1. Memecoins are by far the most powerful and rapid mechanism to economically, financially and ideologically align otherwise completely random groups of people\n\n2. The lack of utility and infra is a FEATURE, not a bug. It allows any talented builder of community, rallier of capital and spreader of narratives to start a project wo the need for technical built up or expertise \n\n3. Yet, this \u201cfeature\u201d can easily be abused - precisely because it requires nothing more than the will of the people, it is easy to fake via a range of mechanisms, especially since \u201cpeople\u201d is hard to define in the age of identity being a wallet address and social media bots and when hordes of real people can be activated via promises of free money \n\n4. That said, we cannot confuse the abuse and the promise - even if the abuse is there, the promise is real. \n\n5. We as an industry have to figure it how to fulfill the promise and curb the abuse. I have 10000% confidence this will happen. There will be infinite number of experiments, platforms, people who will be looking to crack this.\n\n6. As long as we focus on participants and communities who engage in long term PPP, and do not engage with PVP characters for a quick buck, I\u2019m extremely sure we will figure it out together,\n\n7. just like how UGC created a new era for how humans interacted with each other, with some luck, UGM can do the same. \n\nWhy not? \n\nMeoowwwww",

      "text": "No time for an essay, so here\u2019s the quick and dirty draft of the J4J plans:\n\n1. JUP Proposal\n- Propose 30% reduction in JUP total supply\n- Team will voluntarily cut 30% from their assigned allocation \n- Corresponding 30% reduction in Jupuary emissions \n- Possible because we don\u2019t have direct investors in JUP\n- This will cut the fat off the FDV, activate the community to really understand JUP tokenomics, as well as address concerns around high levels of emissions and motivate everyone towards growing the meta together \n\n 2. J4J Experiment\n- Success of the first jupuary, ASR (funded by the LFG fee) and first 2 work groups have created one of the most valuable defi protocols, the most active DAO in crypto, and one of the most engaged communities in web3\n\n- I would like to secure the community buy in for 2 more seasons of jupuary and ASR. I think the completion of these will give us sufficient time to really establish a much wider audience, engaged community and proven DAO to execute on our long term plans (see below)\n\n- If the community refuses to endorse this, we will have to pause Jupuaries and future ASR.  This will not affect the product since airdrops had never been used as incentives for using the product. The product is the marketing for the community, not the other way round.\n\n- Since we do not have any direct investors for Jupiter, the heart of J4J centers arounds the idea that the best way for the Jupiverse is to get JUP in the paws of individuals most likely to  be part of Jupiter long term\n\n3. Community Eats First (CEF)\n- CEF is our team commitment to stand behind our plans and make sure the community eats first \n- Team will be staking 100% of the 1st year cliff for 2 more years to ensure no supply shock \n- Me and Siong (and many others in the team) are committing to locking all tokens vested till June 2026, well beyond the 2 jupuaries.\n- Zero promises, zero expectations, just 100% alignment and commitment \n- Chefs eat last! \n\n4. Long Term Goal:\n-  Jupiter\u2019s goal is exceeding simple - help establish the grand unified market (GUM), build the everything exchange for everyone in the world, and build the underlying liquidity infrastructure for all the key financial use cases in the world \n- We are currently very far away from these, and we will need an amazing community, team and ecosystem to be able to pull this off. \n- Every single proposal and commitment listed above is ultimately, to optimize the chances of us getting there.\n\nThis is of course a draft, full proposal will come up before the actual DAO votes.\n\nJ4J,\n\ud83d\udc31\n\nNotes:\n- For past context on JUP, refer to the kickoff tweet below. The core ideas have not changed a single bit\n- A series of GUM essays will be coming soon to clarify what exactly we think the future of crypto and finance is, and the key role Jupiter wants to play in it",

Reduce and provide certainty on emissions \n2. Cutting off fat from FDV \n3. Strong community alignment on JUP\n\nAnd of course, to enable this, the team will reduce our own allocation as well, so this is NOT a bullshit burn, but a community wide agreement to make the long term prospects of the token stronger than ever before.",

      "text": "JUP CAT PPP\n\nJupiter aims to build the everything exchange, push the giant unified market and help to accelerate the decentralized meta. JUP is the crucial resource and alignment mechanism at the heart of it all.\n\nWhether from a product, adoption, or community point of view, we are extremely early in this journey.  As such, if we are going to have any chance at all of achieving the lofty goals, building and maintaining the trust between the early stakeholders is a crucially important foundation.\n\nIntegrity of JUP \nThe single most important factor in establishing trust within token based communities is the integrity of the token.\n\nIf the crucial stakeholders do not have conviction that the token is being properly managed and distributed in a highly net positive manner, or do not trust that each other have the best intentions, it is like trying to build a skyscraper on a giant pile of tofu.\n\nIt would not matter how advanced the skyscraper is, how pretty the massive solar panel windows are, how experienced the crew is, how much oil money is being funnelled towards building it - you simply cannot do it because the foundation is too shaky.\n\nIf you are worried about being instadumped on, you are not gonna be talking about the 10 year roadmap. Just no way.\n\nWith so many of the recent launches, it almost feels like there\u2019s an adverse PvP relationship between investors, devs and even between community members - leading to a distrusting tension where the conversation becomes dominated by who gets what, who is exit liquidity, rather than making the project great together.\n\nSo how we build trust and PPP? As with so many things in life, the answer circles back to cats.\n\nC.A.T. \nOver cat-decades of observations, I have come to believe that the best way to build trust within the community comes from 3 key aspects:\n\n1. Certainty for token holders\n2. Alignment between key stakeholders\n3. Transparency on token distribution\n\nWithout these key attributes actively being reinforced, it is far more likely than not that the community will fall apart from distrust.\n\nAnd if Jupiter, it is crucial that we have a community and ecosystem that is as cohesive as possible, otherwise the possibility of us getting where we want to be becomes exceedingly low.\n\nIn this essay, we will review how we have tried to build in certainty, alignment and transparency since the genesis moments of JUP, how recent key initiatives have all been focused on trying to achieve this, and how we want to institutionalise key parts of the CAT pact moving forward. \n\nCAT: JUP Genesis\nFrom the moment of the JUP Genesis, we took an extremely comprehensive approach to making sure that the token provided as much certainty, alignment and transparency as possible.\n\nWhy the focus on getting it right at or before genesis? It is because the genesis moment is a crucial moment in time. For example, if there was no transparency at the point of mint, token accountability would become meaningless forever. \n\nTo recap, here\u2019s what we did:\n\n1. A best-in-class token minting ritual documentation which ensured that we are able to effectively track where every single JUP went, as well as offer it up for community audit in the coming months\n\n2. Cold wallets being majority externally controlled by leaders in the ecosystem to ensure that the team will not be able to use it for sale or for voting without preceding public statements\n\n3. Setting up a simple 50/50 tokenomics to articulate the need for clear alignment between the team and the community\n\n4. One of the most inclusive, and widely distributed airdrops with close to 1M wallets who used Jupiter pre-announcement gave us a base of holders who are already intimately familiar with Jupiter \n\n5. Making sure no cats who were part of Jupiter were left behind including great community contributors, compromised wallets as well as Mercurial holders, handling their inclusion in a way that most new token holders would likely agree as being net positive\n\n6. Extremely transparent single launch pool with tokens for sale with zero side deals ensured a very fair initial sale process \n\n7. Keeping the vast majority of the USDC in the launchpool and incrementally withdrawing over 3 months \n\n8. Meticulous documentation and live explanations of the key processes along every step of the way\n\nI have no doubt that these hyper transparent steps, widely distributed drop, and publicly scrutinized nature of the entire launch was a crucial reasons why we survived the FUD, the rocky markets post launch.\n\nMost importantly, these steps also laid the clear foundation for the very high level of trust in the community and active participation in the DAO.\n\nCAT in Ongoing Jupiter Operations\nTo continue to bring certainty, alignment, and transparency to our community, we have embraced two vital principles in our daily operations:\n\na. 50/50 Tokenomics\nThe 50/50 philosophy is the essence of how we think about alignment between the team and the community.  \n\nTokenomics reflect the ethos of a project, and our key ethos is as simple as it gets - For Jupiter, there needs to be an equal weight between a focused entity able to constantly recruit world-class talent, build product, and execute strategy, and a wider community able to fact-check, counterweight, and help to course-correct.\n\nWhen we first announced it, it was cute in theory, but it was unclear how it would play out in practice. 6 months in, we have some clarity. And, as always, it comes back to trust.\n\nThe community needs to trust that the team will be judicious, using the part managed by the team in ways that are net positive for the Jupiverse. \n\nAt the same time, the team needs to trust that the community will independently grow its own leadership and have the good judgement to make crucial decisions that have a huge impact on the future of the protocol.\n\nAnd after all many trials of fire, we now have the world's largest and most active DAO, with extremely dynamic debates happening over every single vote, big or small. \n\nThis sets us up really, really well to tackle some really big topics, which we shall see in a bit!\n\nb. Community Eats First\nCEF is our signature effort to provide a high level of certainty to the community and holders that there will be no supply shock or lingering harm from the team allocations, and that the team is fully committed to executing all proposed plans over a long period of time.\n\nAs a quick recap:\n- The team will be staking 100% of the 1st year cliff for 2 more years. \n- Me and Siong are committing to locking all tokens vested till June 2026, well beyond the 2 intended Jupuaries. \n- Most of the other team members have committed to lock the vast majority of their tokens, liquidating only what they need for their personal financial security \n- If the token reduction vote passes, the team will voluntarily cut the corresponding amount as well.\n\nThe team is committed to making sure that our interests are 100% fully aligned both with the community as well whatever plans are being proposed. \n\nCommunity eats first, chefs eat last\n\nc. DAO Voting On Crucial Token Measures\nFrom a certainty, alignment and transparency point of view, why is is so important that the DAO votes on key measures like token reduction, future Jupuaries and ASRs?\n\nFirst off, these proposals affect the community portion of the tokens, so it is crucial that the community has the final say over what gets distributed eventually.\n\nSecondly, and more subtly, if key processes that have a very material impact on the circulating supply of the token like Jupuaries are executed without sufficient debate and attention, there is a strong potential of creating a massive amount of misalignment between the team, users and holders, allowing a potential PVP situation to emerge. \n\nFor example, the camp of those who believe in Jupuaries to spread JUP far and wide might come into violent conflict with those who wish to prevent emissions at all costs.\n\nTo avoid this PVP situation - with all of its in-fighting, FUD, and pain - we need to bring the conversation into the open. By requiring a vote, we create the space for a massive debate on the pros and cons of each action. In the end, the decision will have legitimacy precisely because everyone had a chance to make their opinion heard.\n\nIn order to avoid a civil PvP war, we must have a civil PPP debate. \n\nd. Crypto's first ever live community audit for token distribution\nTo provide a high level of transparency for the community, we did the first live community audit for JUP with the goal of accounting for every single JUP that left the genesis wallets. \n\nWe believe that this is the first such public accounting ever done in crypto, and we will continue to do this regularly as our pledge for maintaining the core integrity of the JUP token.\n\ne. zer0 \nIt is our observation that empty promises and unmet expectations and constant moon yearning results for a very large part of mistrust and disillusionment in crypto today.\n\nWe adhere to the zer0 philosophy, which means zero promise, zero expectations, but 100% commitment and determination.\n\nWe know where we want to go, but we will not pretend we know how to get there. We will experiment and push our way there.\n\nCommitting To The C.A.T. Pact (DRAFT)\nWe believe that JUP is the most valuable resource that we have, and we are committed to making sure that there's always a very high level of trust involved in the integrity of JUP.\n\nAs such, we officially commit to the boomer CAT Pact:\n\n1. Regular Community Audits for JUP. Every 6 months, we\u2019ll publicly review the distributions of the JUP to date\n2. 100% Disclosures of Token Sales. If any tokens are released for\n3. Advance Notice of Token Releases. If we release any tokens from the reserve for strategic reasons, we\u2019ll carefully manage the release to be in proportion to market liquidity. And we\u2019ll make sure to communicate these releases at least 3 months in advance.\n4. Transparency on Treasury. All wallets will be clearly labelled so that usage of JUP can be easily tracked. \n5. All community allocated tokens will be distributed via a DAO vote for full visibility.\n\nThis is a draft pact, but we expect to formalize it over the next few weeks. Ideally, this will serve not just as a useful guideline to us, but also to all teams who wish to build more trust within their own communities.\n\nPPP & CAT\nIn this essay, we have outlined the very elaborate measures we have taken to build in more certainty, alignment and transparency, with the end goal of building more trust within the Jupiter community.\n\nSo where does the idea of PPP come in?  Simple.\n\nWhen there is no trust, PvP will happens.\nWhen there is trust, PPP can happen.\n\nWith the right mechanisms, communications and safeguards in place, I think we stand a good chance of becoming one of the most PPP communities around.\n\nAnd that will be so great, because nothing will make me happier than trying to get to the decentralized meta with everyone. \n\nEnd of the day, regardless of the outcome, it's just so, so much more fun when we do it together as one cohesive community. \n\nLet's try ya? I will do my best too.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc08\n\nPS: I promise i did not come out with the C.A.T deliberately, i was just thinking about the core things needed, and boom, CAT just came up. I swear sometimes life is indeed super circular. \ud83d\udede",

If so, surely there is no need to acquire the entire setup. \n4) How exactly does going multi jurisdiction help?\n5) Is it possible to get a respected independent party to be in the group to act as both communication and signer?\n\nFor my personal role, I started WBTC in 2018 with @loi_luu, @bencxr and others as a joint initiative between kyber, bitgo and republic to bring BTC to defi. I have not been involved in recent years, but outside looking in, bitgo has been excellent custodians of what has grew into an immensely important asset.\n\nOne hugely positive thing that can arise from this would be heightened awareness of how WBTC functions. \n\nFor a crucially shared asset like WBTC, it would be greatly beneficial for all holders and builders to have as much awareness as possible, and then make their own judgement on whether to hodl or switch.\n\nThat\u2019s the purpose of the conversation tomorrow, and I look forward to seeing everyone there!",

      "text": "DAO Budgets: Risk Limiting / Human Accountability \n\nI believe the key to successful DAO budgets is not complex technical tools nor path limiting KPIs, though these are the 2 tools we instinctively request and reach for.\n\nInstead, I believe in good old risk limiting and human accountability.\n\n1. Risk Limiting - Limits damage via crawl backs and phased releases. Prioritize heavily community members with strong proof of work in community. Scope it such that even if a given budget is a complete failure, the damage to the system is limited, and we learn.\n\n2. Human Accountabilty - Make sure that the recipients of the budget communicates intention before the release, and needs to do a public reflection on that after sufficient time has passed and results are clear. Capacity for DAO to cut future funding if accountability is unclear.\n\nWhy?\nUsing risk limiting and accountability rather than inflexible systems and random KPIs (people tend to promise random shit under pressure), we allow for much more flexibility, room to navigate and capacity for empathy.\n\nWhile I understand the skepticism towards all things DAO budget related (given the utter abuse in this space), I\u2019m very positive that we can focus instead on the positive potential of the people (hah, another ppp) instead.  \n\nPPP & Trust\nEnd of the day, a good DAO and community is not made from code or money. It\u2019s made from people, good solid people who we *have to trust* have the best intentions. \n\nIf there is no trust, it\u2019s impossible to work in a PPP manner to grow the pie together, since the environment will be predominantly occupied by negativity and demands. \n\nSo trust we will in the good of people and our peers - with solid risk limits and firm accountability measure of course.\n\n\ud83e\ude77\ud83d\udc08",

Same idea, but based on some oracle based performance milestone like MC or price.\n\nIf you have any ideas or features you want to see, feel free to hit up @xianxlb and @sudoku_defi!",

The best mobile swap experience in crypto, with zero configuration, zero platform fees and auto retries\n2. Focused onramp to Solana, with Apple Pay, Credit Card, etc\n3. All the tokens you can possibly want to trade in Solana from the newest Pump tokens to the most OG coins - all sorted, verifed and easily searchable. \n\nIt certainly took much longer than we wanted to, with endless tweaks to make the decentralized swap as smooth as we wanted it to,  testing out multiple onramp partners, getting the needed backend services to work well, building and dropping many features and of course getting it live.\n\nBut now it\u2019s here, and we get to build up this baseline application together as a community!\n\nIt\u2019s very very very early of course, but do let us know how to improve it, and as with everything we do, let\u2019s work together to make it as awesome as possible. \n\n\ud83d\udc31",

Review feedback from all sources\n2. Address all main areas of concern and opposition\n3. Put up a new proposal that we can stand behind \n\nExpect a lot of live reviews of the above 3 things over the weekend.\n\nThe next vote will happen early next week - monday or tuesday, aka 2/3 Dec.\n\nWhile this uncertainty is definitely tiring, and weighing down on sentiment, it is also crucial to remember that if we do unify behind a plan - we will emerge far stronger, aware of each other and innovate on a ton of decentralized governance  and communications along the way.\n\nFrom the feedback, there really is not much division - we are an incredibly long term oriented community who wants the best for the Jupiverse, we just need to get there together.\n\nOn my end, the goal remains unchanged - establish long term strategic clarity by Catstubul, work towards the crucial 2027 checkpoint, and define the future of decentralized communities, money and power together with everyone.\n\nThe next vote is a crucial test for both me and the community, and I have full confidence that we will ace it.\n\nYou matter.\nJUP matters.\nJupiter really matters.\n\nLet's prove it.",

Any challenges or issues arising from this incident are mine alone to own, not yours. I stand fully behind the incredible work we do together.\n\nAlso, sincere apologies to anyone who felt targeted or that I didn\u2019t care about them because of the color of their skin. Racism is obviously completely unacceptable  and I love you all. I have years of operating both online & offline to prove that this is not how I behave in my personal or professional life. \n\nLastly, I regret the negative attention brought to the ecosystem because of my words and certainly reject the notion that usage of derogatory terms targeting others should be normalized.\n\nThe comments were made when shooting the shit with my Twitter friends Mitch and @TeTheGamer. Read it for yourself - the terms were brought up in response to a request for verification for a very interestingly named token or to them in a friendly way.\n\nIntention and context are key in determining any kind of maliciousness, which I think was completely missing in much of the conversation here, particularly in the outrage. I do thank everyone who took the time to write thoughtful responses - it certainly informed a lot of the thinking above.\n\nMost of all, as a professional trouble making cat, i would like to thank everyone who has been supporting me in public responses, dms, discord and all. Your support was absolutely crucial & very touching. ILY all of you, and i will find time to thank everyone personally over the next few weeks - and hopefully - at Catstanbul!\n\nI accept my shortcomings.

Can only be claimed with an invite code, which only sender has\n2. Sender can cancel anytime\n3. Automatic and customizable expiry \n\nNon custodial, full onchain, and normie-friendly!",

(for guys only, 10 extra points if you do the pushups shirtless, i repeat for guys only)\n\nwe will do a full section on money 3.0, where we will have lots of great partners announcing stuff. at the end of the day, we will do a major platform announcement, so stay tuned for that!!\n\ni think there is a talent show & party at the end of the day where soju sings, but i am not sure.\n\nday 2: $JUP and J.U.P day\n\nsecond day will be an intense \n\n day. we will open the day with some very important JUP announcements, and then do the 2nd transparency audit midday.\n\nafter the JUP announcement, there will be 3 main things going on:\n\n1. Deep dives with teams. Come meet the engineers working on the very features you love, bitch to them , brainstorm w them, jam w them.\n\n2. J.U.P DAO Working day. There will be an insane backlog of like 9-10 votes coming up in the coming weeks after catstanbul (ASR YAY!) - \n\n3. Unconference - the main area will be converted into an open area for anyone to share their stories and all. i will be doing a session on how to turn weakness into strengths, kash will be doing one on how to live w all that hair, and it will be a super fun.\n\nplease come share stories!\n\nend of day 2: Burning Cat\n\nand of coz, at the end of the second day, we will wrap up with a giant burning cat ceremony. don't worry, no cats will actually be burnt, real or fake ones, but 3B very real JUP tokens will most definitely be.\n\nand we will round off w a fun party with lots of cats of all varieties. \n\nday 3: BACK TO WORK\n\nand most importantly on day 3, right back to work. ;)\n\nhope this clarifies what is actually gonna happen over the weekend. See everyone soon!\n\n\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc31\n\nPS: there's also going to be a 100k bounty to reward the best jupiter contents tweeted during the event (whether live or remote), and the team will also follow them, so plz do share share share.\n\nPS2: jupiverse, there's no cap, ILY",

      "text": "Hi, I\u2019m meow from Jupiter, and I also cofounded Meteora.\n\nFirstly, I\u2019d like to reiterate my confidence that no one at Jupiter or Meteora committed any insider trading or financial wrongdoing, or received any tokens inappropriately.\n\nSecondly, we are hiring an independent 3rd party (Fenwick & West, one of the most reputable law firms in the world) to investigate and issue an report which they will publish independently.\n\nThirdly, I stand by Ben and his statement. I believe him when he says there was no financial inappropriateness in dealing with partners.\n\nMeteora has been operating as a separate entity from Jupiter for over a year now and Ben has been running it without my significant involvement. He has done a great job building up the team, the most innovative DEX in the past year and the most active LP community in the world.\n\nWhile I am 100% confident about Ben\u2019s character,\u00a0 as a project lead he has also shown a lack of judgement and care about some of the core aspects of the project (given its current size and reputation) over the past couple of months.\n\nAnd this is unfortunately unacceptable. Ben understands this, and has chosen to resign. Going forward, we will be looking for new leadership for Meteora.\n\nBen has been an extremely helpful and kind participant in the ecosystem for a while now, as many people can attest. I ask everyone not jump to conclusions and be as kind to him as possible as he seeks to clear his name.\n\n> JUP, Jupiter, Me\n\nJUP has been the gold standard when it comes to token transparency. We are the only major protocol to ever account for every token over the course of 3 audits. We have never sold tokens OTC and every single major token use is carefully documented and planned in our audits. Token integrity is key to us since the very first day.\n\nSecondly, Jupiter is one of the most non-extractive players in the ecosystem. We have allowed users to swap tens of billions for free and our partners to make hundreds of millions of dollars in fees with minimal take on our end.\n\nOver the last year our perpetuals fees are transparently documented, reported along with the two best audit partners in the space. Even our recent Ultra Mode is the first time we are charging users for swaps, and at 0.05%-0.1%, it\u2019s 10x-20x lower than other main platforms.\n\nVast majority of fees are kept on Solana and invested in jupSOL/JLP and stay within the ecosystem, other than amounts used to fund talent acquisition and operating expenses.\u00a0\n\nOn my end, I have not sold a single JUP, nor do I regularly trade memecoins. I have been offered free tokens many times for marketing, and I\u2019ve always rejected every single one. I diamond hand most of the tokens that I received from investment / advisory in the past prior to Jupiter.\u00a0\n\n> Watershed Moment For Crypto\n\nI would like to apologize for the recent stress caused to the team, the community & the ecosystem as a whole.\n\nEven though we hold very high standards for ourselves for token integrity at Jupiter, I want to apologize that we haven\u2019t held other projects in the space to the same standard.\n\nThis is a watershed moment for our industry and it\u2019s very very obvious to me now that the way to grow the industry is not simply via more tokens but to have projects that have the same level of token certainty, long-term alignment, and extreme transparency like we practice with JUP.\n\nOne of my main goals will be to create permissionless products, operating systems, and ethical standards that I believe can form the new foundation of crypto moving forward.\n\n1. Making jup.ag the best decentralized platform\n2. Building Jupnet as the network to connect everything\n3.  Driving the certainty, alignment and transparency standards for our industry\n\nI\u2019m not perfect and I\u2019ve learnt a lot of crucial lesson. I hope to take the lessons from this and the robust systems we have built for JUP to define the next major phase of our industry - growing up.\n\n\ud83d\udc31",

      "text": "First off, a big congrats to our latest full work group - the Catdet Working Group! They have been core members of the community for the longest time since the genesis of the Jupiverse, and as a result, received the support of many, many in the community.\n\nEver since we pioneered the idea of decentralized workgroups a year ago, we have been iterating on it constantly with the aim of creating a new completely model that combined the power of small autonomous teams, with the legitimacy that can only be provided by the community.\n\nToday, with the passing of the latest DAO vote, we welcome the Catdet Working Group (CAWG), who will educate, strengthen and grow the core of the Jupiter community across the key online channels as well as regional efforts.\n\nThe members of the workgroup, @julianhzhu @usimeow @Opacksx @Bingbongdiddly @RolexGoldTweets have been the most active, passionate and supportive members of the community from day 1, as anyone who have spent any amount of time in discord or reddit can testify.\n\nThey now get the legitimacy, and budget over the next year to really prove that they are able to drive value to the jupiverse ecosystem and grow the core of the community, and i strongly encourage everyone to really get to know them and work with them.\n\nIn the last planetary call and j&j podcast, i expressed my desire to see a more clear scope of the problems they are solving for the jupiverse, and it is clear from the voting n debate that quite a few felt the same as well. As such, they are actively working on key changes to make their ongoing contribution is visible, tangible and more public.\n\nRemember, if the community deems their work unsatisfactory or if they drop off, there will be options to enforce the accountability, so i do encourage everyone to support this important work while also really giving them the feedback they need to do well and thrive.\n\nOn my end, i am super grateful to them for being such consistent members of the community, proud of them for stepping up, and intend to help them improve along the way to address key concerns the community have.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc08",

The conversations I had over the 7.5 hour Twitter space was particularly instructive, with crucial insights from community members like @nuckyverse, @BChodly and @ALLEYCATNY had been very instructive.\n\nWhile we are doing much better on regular comms, the high level intentions and strategy needs to be much more formalized to repair a lot of the fud and emotional tearing that happened in the last few month, as well as clarify a lot of the key approaches.\n\nhuge quarter ahead, gonna execute on many fronts, let\u2019s go!",
