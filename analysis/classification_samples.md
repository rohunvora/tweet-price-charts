For some reference, when JUP launched, one common complaint was that our liquidity pool was way too big, making it hard to pump.

Of course, that was precisely by design, since we want to remove the ability for any holder to tank to rekt everyone. 

And it did happen! Some whales did massive multi million exit at 40+ cents, but thanks to the liquidity pool, the price held up just fine and recovered shortly after fud went over. 

But yeh, the complaint was actually very real

The more things that are tokenized, the more markets meet people where they are at with their own personal interests, skill sets and world views. 

There’s a little degen in everyone it’s just waiting for the right tokens.
