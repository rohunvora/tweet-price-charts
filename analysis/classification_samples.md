Thank you for the nice comments! Overall, I think I have always been lucky.

It (the process) was extremely painful, but it didn't break me.

```

**Reasoning:** The tweet is a personal reflection on hardship, resilience, and reputation rather than a product/token/market update. The tone is introspective and acknowledges pain, fitting a reflective, vulnerable intent.

**Classification:** token/defend [llm]

**Text (1 tweet(s)):**
```
there are two big pushbacks on our model, one of which is valid and one of which I think is not:

"giving up control sucks for founders"
agreed, working on improving this 👍

"having a liquid token sucks for founders &amp; causes them to focus short-term"
disagree, there are pain
```

**Reasoning:** The tweet addresses criticism about having a liquid token and argues against the pushback, which is primarily defensive. While it mentions improving the model, the dominant focus is rebutting concerns about token liquidity for founders.
