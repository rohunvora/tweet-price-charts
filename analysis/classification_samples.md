#USELESS coin once again displaying incredible relative strength!

it's currently outperforming majors like $BTC, $ETH, $SOL and $HYPE

it also stands out impressively compared to memecoins like $DOGE, $TRUMP, $SPX, #FARTCOIN and $WIF

this reminds me of how $USELESS consistently outperformed everything during down markets when it had its first parabolic rally from $4.2m to $420m market cap
