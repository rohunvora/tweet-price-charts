# Current Core Problem

## The Hater's Critique

As someone landing on this page with zero context:

### 1. "Tweets on charts." - What does this even mean?

I literally don't know what I'm looking at. Whose tweets? What charts? Why should I care? This headline assumes I already know what this site does.

### 2. The scatter plot is chaos

A bunch of red and green dots. No labels I understand. "1h impact" and "24h impact" - impact on what? This looks like noise. If there's a pattern here, I can't see it, and you're not helping me see it.

### 3. "When they tweet" - Who is "they"?

A heatmap of hours. Cool, I guess? But I don't know who these people are. "meow" tweeted a lot at 2am UTC. Why do I care about meow's sleep schedule?

### 4. "When they go quiet" - Still no context

Founders went quiet and price moved. Is that... good? Bad? Meaningful? You're showing me data but not telling me why it matters.

### 5. The asset grid includes FARTCOIN and USELESS

I'm supposed to take this seriously? This looks like a meme site. If there's real insight here, it's buried under joke tokens.

### 6. No thesis

After scrolling through four modules, I still don't know:
- What this site is trying to show me
- Why founder tweets might matter for price
- What I should do with this information
- Why I should spend another second here

### 7. It's a dashboard disguised as a landing page

This feels like something built for someone who already knows what they're looking for. It's not inviting exploration - it's assuming expertise.

## The Fundamental Problem

The page has no **narrative arc**. It doesn't:
1. Hook me with why I should care
2. Give me context for what I'm seeing
3. Build toward an insight or revelation
4. Leave me with something memorable

It just... presents data. Museum-style presentation works when visitors already want to be there. This needs to **earn** attention first.

## What's Missing

1. **Context**: Who are these founders? Why track their tweets?
2. **Thesis**: Even a subtle one - "founders tweet, things happen"
3. **Story**: Guide me through the data, don't dump it on me
4. **Stakes**: Why does this matter? To whom?
5. **Takeaway**: What should I think/feel/do after visiting?

## The Hard Truth

This is a technically impressive visualization tool looking for a reason to exist. The craft is there. The insight is not.

The user said they want to post this with almost no caption and have it speak for itself. Right now, it doesn't speak - it mumbles technical jargon at strangers.
